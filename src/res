            *Square Roots.*
            You might remember that “minus times minus 
            is plus” and that “plus times plus is plus”.
            (Why? The enemy of my enemy is my friend.)
            So any nonzero number multiplied by itself
            is positive. For example,
        
            $$
            (-2) \times (-2) = 4
            $$
        
            _|and|_
        
            $$
            2 \times 2 = 4
            $$
        
            are both positive. But $\sqrt{4}$ is, by 
            definition, the unique _nonnegative_ 
            solution to $x^2 = 4$. Hence, and whether 
            you like it or not,
                
            $$\sqrt{(-2)^2} = 2$$

            and, in particular, it is _not_ true that
        
            $$
            \sqrt{x^{2}} \rt{0.1} = \rt{0.1} x
            $$
        
            for every real number $x$. Instead we have
        
            $$
            \sqrt{x^{2}} \rt{0.1} = \rt{0.1} |x|
            $$
        
            for every real number $x$, where $|x|$ 
            denotes the absolute value of $x$.
        
            (Nb: If ever you want to indicate both 
            solutions of the equation $x^2 = 4$ you
            can always use the notation “$\pm \sqrt{4}$”. 
            This is what happens, for example, in the 
            maybe-well-known formula
        
            $$
            x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}
            $$
        
            for the solutions to the quadratic equation
            $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.)
        
            Now we can ponder, say,
        
            $$
            \sqrt{0.5}
            $$
        
            whose value is—by definition—the unique
            nonnegative solution to
        
            $$
            x^2 = 0.5.
            $$
        
            As beginners, there's nothing wrong with 
            trying to solve this equation by trial and
            error. With $x = {1\over 4}$, for example,
            we find
        
            $$
            x^2 = {1\over 4}\times{1\over 4} = {1\over 16}
            $$
        
            so $x = {1\over 4}$ is not a solution of 
            the equation, being apparently too small. 
            Increasing $x$ to $x = {1\over 2}$, say, we 
            find
        
            $$
            x^2 = {1\over 2}\times{1\over 2} = {1\over 4}
            $$
        
            which is better, since $1/4$ is closer to $1/2$, 
            but still too small. Increasing $x$ by $1/4$ 
            again, say, to $x = {3\over 4}$, we find
        
            $$
            x^2 = {3\over 4}\times{3\over 4} = {9\over 16}
            $$
        
            which—surprise!—is actually pretty close to 
            $1/2$, as $1/2 = 8/16$. And since $9/16 > 0.5$, 
            $\sqrt{0.5}$ must be a little _less_ than 
            ${3\over 4} = 0.75$.
        
            In last resort, and in reasonably good 
            agreement with our observations, a calculator 
            reveals that
        
            $$
            \sqrt{0.5} = 0.7071067...
            $$
        
            where the decimals trail off with no pattern. 
            (This number is irrational.) Even so, the fact 
            that $\sqrt{0.5}$ is _greater_ than $0.5$ is 
            often perceived as counterintuitive.
        
            You can think of it this way: multiplying a 
            value by $0.7071$, or approximately $\sqrt{0.5}$, 
            is like taking $70.71\%$ of that value—for 
            example, say,
        
            $$
            605 \cdot 0.7071 = 427.7955
            $$
        
            is $70.71\%$ of $605$, and so on—so if we 
            multiply _twice_ by $0.7071$ we obtain 
            “$70.71\%$ of $70.71\%$” and it just so happens 
            that “$70.71\%$ of $70.71\%$” is close to 
            $50\%$.
        
            The point is: if “$X\%$ of $X\%$” equals $50\%$, 
            then, of course, $\rt{0.03}X > 50$—that much 
            seems logical—and, with a little thought, the
            same phenomenon explains why $\sqrt{0.5} > 0.5$.

            *Fractions and Division.*
            An elementary fraction, or division, such as
        
            $$
            {50 \over 2}
            $$
        
            can be thought of in a few different ways:
        
            |> List
        
                Fifty halves (i.e., $50 \times {1\over 2}$).
        
                The size obtained when something of size 
                fifty is divided into two equal parts 
                (answer: $25$).
        
                The number of times that $2$ goes into $50$ 
                (answer: $25$, because it takes twenty-five
                $2$'s to make up $50$).
        
            But $50/2$ is a ratio of integers, which makes 
            things particularly nice! For a ratio of 
            decimals, such as, say,
        
            $$
            {1 \over 0.01}
            $$
        
            our possible points of view are going to be
            more restricted. Thankfully, however, we can 
            still characterize this fraction as the 
            answer to the question “how many times does 
            $0.01$ go into $1$?” as in the third option 
            above. And, indeed,
        
            $$
            {1 \over 0.01} \,=\,100
            $$
        
            because $0.01$ goes $100$ times into $1$. For 
            that matter,
        
            $$
            { 1 \over 0.001} = 1000,\qquad{1 \over 0.0001} = 10000,\quad\,\,\,\,\textrm{(etc)}
            $$
        
            by the same reasoning, which explains why 
            dividing by smaller and smaller numbers produces 
            larger and larger results (and, by extension, 
            why dividing by $0$ is undefined).
        
            |> Pause
        
            *Note.* In general, the ratio of two decimal 
            numbers can be turned into a ratio of integers 
            by multiplying the ratio top and bottom by a 
            suitable power of $10$. E.g.:
        
            $$
            {1.42 \over 0.8} = {100 \cdot 1.42 \over 100 \cdot 0.8} = {142 \over 80} = {71 \over 40}.
            $$
        
            This example was chosen randomly, and, if you
            allow, we would like to see how large $71/40$ 
            really is (one second!):
        
            $$
            \begin{align}
            {71 \over 40} \,&=\, {40 + 30 + 1 \over 40} \,=\, {40 \over 40} + {30 \over 40} + {1 \over 40}\\
            \,&=\, 1 + {3 \over 4} + {1 \over 4}\!\cdot \!{1 \over 10}\up{1.5}\\
            \,&=\, 1 + 0.75 + 0.025 = 1.775\up{1.5}
            \end{align}
            $$
        
            ...so we find, among others, that $71$ is exactly
            $77.5\%$ greater than $40$. (Interesting, no?)

            *Distributivity.*
            As you might already know, a number that 
            multiplies a sum can be brought “inside” the 
            sum. For example,
        
            $$
            5(10 + 2) \,=\, 5\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 5\!\cdot\!2
            $$
        
            (five times twelve equals fifty plus ten), or
        
            $$
            a(b + c) = ab + ac
            $$
        
            more generally. This property is known as the
            _distributivity of multiplication over addition_,
            or _distributivity_ for short.
        
            (We might finally clarify that ‘$\cdot$’ means
            “times”, i.e., the same as ‘$\times$’. Moreover,
            when we write
        
            $$
            5\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 5\!\cdot\!2
            $$
        
            we really mean
        
            $$
            (5\!\cdot\!10) + (5\!\cdot\!2)
            $$
        
            as opposed to something else, such as
        
            $$
            ((5\!\cdot\!10) + 5)\!\cdot\! 2,
            $$
        
            because multiplication takes precedence over 
            addition, by default.)
        
            A little more generally, one has such identities 
            as
        
            $$
            (a + b)(C + D) \,=\, aC + bC + aD + bD
            $$
        
            that come from multiplying every term of the first 
            parenthesis with every term of the second 
            parenthesis. Indeed,

            $$
            (a + b)(C + D) = (a + b)C + (a + b)D
            $$
        
            by one application of distributivity, while
        
            $$
            (a + b)C = aC + bC
            $$
        
            $$
            (a + b)D = aD + bD
            $$
        
            by distributivity again.
        
            |> Example
        
                One has
        
                $$
                \begin{align}
                (10 + 2)(10 + 4) \,&=\, 10\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 10\!\cdot\!4 \,+\, 2\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 2\!\cdot\!4\\
                \,&=\, 100 \,+\, 40 \,+\, 20 \,+\, 8\\
                \,&=\, 168
                \end{align}
                $$
        
                so $12 \times 14 = 168$.
        
            |> Example
        
                One has
        
                $$
                \begin{align}
                (10 + 3)(10 + 3) \,&=\, 10\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 10\!\cdot\!3 \,+\, 3\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 3\!\cdot\!3\\
                \,&=\, 100 \,+\, 30 \,+\, 30 \,+\, 9\\
                \,&=\, 169
                \end{align}
                $$
        
                so $13 \times 13 = 169$.
        
            (The fact that $13 \times 13$ is exactly one 
            greater than $12 \times 14$ is a bit curious 
            indeed.)
        
            If we start from the afore-mentioned identity
        
            $$
            (a + b)(C + D) \,=\, aC + bC + aD + bD
            $$
        
            and set $C = a$, $D = b$, we find
        
            $$
            (a + b)(a + b) \,=\, aa + ba + ab + bb
            $$
        
            or, equivalently,
        
            $$
            (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
            $$
        
            since $(a + b)(a + b) = (a + b)^2$, $aa = a^2$ 
            and $bb = b^2$. (This is the _binomial expansion 
            of degree two_, but such terminology is not very 
            important at this stage.)
        
            |> Example
        
                By the last formula (or “binomial expansion
                of degree two”),
        
                $$
                \begin{align}
                \up{1} (10 + 3)^2 \,&=\, 10\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 2\!\cdot\!3\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 3\!\cdot\!3 \\
                \up{1} \,&=\, 100 + 60 + 9 \\
                \up{1} \,&=\, 169
                \end{align}
                $$
        
                which agrees with Example 2.
        
            On the other hand, setting $C = a$, $D = -b$ in
        
            $$
            (a + b)(C + D) = aC + aD + bC + bD
            $$
        
            gives
        
            $$
            (a + b)(a + (-b)) = aa + a(-b) + ba + b(-b)
            $$
        
            or, less pedantically,
        
            $$
            (a + b)(a - b) = aa - ab + ba - bb
            $$
        
            or
        
            $$
            (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2
            $$
        
            since $- ab + ba = 0$, $aa = a^2$, $bb = b^2$. Note that
        
            $$
            a^2 - b^2
            $$
        
            is
        
            __a difference of squares__
        
            whence _a difference of squares can always be 
            factored_. (Factored as $(a + b)(a - b)$, that
            is.) (PS: “Factored” means “written as a product”.)
        
            |> Example

                $$
        
                is a difference of squares, $19$ can be 
                factored. (On the other hand $19$ is a prime 
                number, but nevermind.)

                1 - x^2
                $$
        
                can be factored, because
        
                $$
                1 = 1^2
                $$
        
                implies that
        
                $$
                1 - x^2
                $$
        
                truly is “a difference of squares”. And, indeed,
        
                $$
                1 - x^2 = (1 - x)(1 + x)
                $$
        
                as per “$\rt{0.04}a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$”.
        
            In relation to distributivity, we should also 
            mention the simple but important fact that 
            multiplying a difference by $-1$ _reverses_ the 
            difference. That is,
        
            $$
            (-1)(a - b) \,=\, b - a
            $$
        
            or, for short,
        
            $$
            -(a - b) \,=\, b - a
            $$
        
            because, indeed,
        
            $$
            \begin{align}
            (-1)(a - b) \,&=\, (-1)(a + (-b)) \\
            \,&=\, (-1)a + (-1)(-b) \\
            \,&=\, -a + b
            \end{align}
            $$
        
            by distributivity (used in the second step).
        
            |> Example
        
                We have $-(10 - 3) = 3 - 10$. 
                (Because $-7 = -7$, as it would be, haha.)

            *Epilogue.* Do you remember the near miss between
        
            $$
            12\cdot 14 \,=\, 168
            $$
        
            and
        
            $$
            13 \cdot 13 \,=\, 13^2 \,=\, 169
            $$
        
            ...? Well if you observe, additionally, that
        
            $$
            \begin{align}
            11\,\cdot\,13 &= 12^2 - 1\\
            10\,\cdot\,12 &= 11^2 - 1\\
            9\,\cdot\,11 &= 10^2 - 1
            \end{align}
            $$
        
            (etc) you might become suspicious of a pattern! 
            But the mystery is rather thin: we have
        
            $$
            (n - 1)(n + 1) \,=\, n^2 - 1
            $$
        
            for _every_ real number $n$ because of the 
            formula
        
            $$
            (a - b)(a + b) \,=\, a^2 - b^2
            $$
        
            for a difference of squares!

            A pair of algebraic expressions of the form

            a + b,\, a - b
            $$
        
            is called a _conjugate pair_. For example,
        
            $$
            n + 1,\, n - 1
            $$
        
            is a conjugate pair, as is
        
            $$
            \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2},\,\, \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}
            $$
        
            and so on. (Generally speaking, conjugate pairs
            are good things to multiply together.)

                    ${1 \over n^2}$ for large $n$, which is

                is _roughly_ $1/n^2$ for large $n$. But how 
                far off is this exactly? (I.e., what is the
                difference between ${1 \over n} - {1 \over n+1}$ 
                and ${1 \over n^2}$?) And _roughly_ how much is
                this far-offness, for large $n$?

            *Slopes.*
            The _slope_ of a line is a mathematical measure
            of how “steep” a line is. Here are a few examples
            (for an explanation of the values, see below):
        
            |> Image
                src images/chapter_2_1.svg
        
            To explain, the slope of a line is...
        
            __the number of units the line goes up with each
            unit to the right__
        
            ...assuming that numbers on the $y$-axis increase
            going up and that numbers on the $x$-axis increase
            going right, as is usually the case. One can also
            describe slope as...
        
            __the amount of vertical change per unit of
            horizontal change__
        
            ...more elegant!
        
            For example, the line below has slope 1, because
            it goes up by $1$ unit for each unit to the right:

                src images/slope_1_example.svg
                container_classes pl-[2px]
        
            On the other hand, the line below has slope
            $-0.5$, because it goes up by _minus_ $0.5$ units
            with each unit to the right:

                src images/slope_0.5_example.svg
                container_classes pl-[19.5px]
        
            (Etc.)
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *Measuring Slope.*
            The slope of a line is also the ratio of vertical
            change to horizontal change between any two
            distinct points $A$, $B$ on the line:
        
            |> Image
                src images/31.svg
                container_classes mt-6 mb-2
                cloud_image true
        
            $$ \te{slope} = {\te{vertical change from A to B} \over \te{horizontal change from A to B}} $$
        
            Indeed, dividing the vertical change by the
            horizontal change gives the per-horizontal-unit
            vertical change.
        
            More precisely, if
        
            $$ A = (x_1, y_1) $$
        
            and
        
            $$ B = (x_2, y_2) $$
        
            then
        
            $$ x_2 - x_1 $$
        
            and
        
            $$ y_2 - y_1 $$
        
            are the horizontal _&_ the vertical change,
            respectively, from $A$ to $B$, so
        
            $$
            \te{slope} = {y_2 - y_1 \over x_2 - x_1}
            $$

            more succinctly. We call this the _slope formula_.
        
            |> Example
        
                A line that passes through the points
        
                $$A = (-2, 5)$$
        
                and
        
                $$B = (4, 1)$$
        
                has slope
        
                $${1 - 5 \over 4 - (-2)} = {-4 \over 6} = - {2 \over 3}.$$

            (The main thing to understand about Example
            1 is that
        
            $$ 1 - 5 $$
        
            is the vertical change from $A$ to $B$, while
        
            $$ 4 - (-2) $$
        
            is the horizontal change from $A$ to $B$.)

            *Sign Combinations.*
            Technically, quantities such as
        
            $$ x_2 - x_1 $$
        
            and
        
            $$ y_2 - y_1 $$
        
            are not distances but _differences_ (or,
            equivalently, _changes_). A distance, by
            definition, is a nonnegative number, while a
            difference carries no such restriction.
        
            In particular, since
        
            $$ x_2 - x_1 $$
        
            can be positive or negative, while
        
            $$ y_2 - y_1 $$
        
            can be positive or negative or zero (more on
            zero below), the following sign combinations
            arise (lines of slope zero not included):

            In fact, we _should_ be able to algebraically
            verify that the slope formula gives the same
            answer if $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ swap
            places, or, namely, to show that the fractions

            are somehow equal. But, indeed,
        
            $$ {y_2 - y_1 \over x_2 - x_1} = {-(y_2 - y_1) \over -(x_2 - x_1)} = {y_1 - y_2 \over x_1 - x_2} $$

            which verifies this hypothesis. In particular,
        
            $$ {y_2 - y_1 \over x_2 - x_1}\qquad\,\,\,\,\,\te{and}\,\,\,\,\,\qquad{y_1 - y_2 \over x_1 - x_2} $$
        
            are equally valid incarnations of the slope
            formula.

            If
        
            $$ x_2 - x_1 = 0 $$
        
            the slope formula “breaks down” in the sense that
            division by 0 is undefined. This occurs, e.g., if
            we attempt to measure the slope of a vertical
            line:
        
            |> Image

            Indeed, vertical lines have _undefined_ slope.
            Moreover the bad case
        
            $$ x_2 - x_1 = 0 $$
        
            can also occur another way, namely if the points
            $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ coincide. In that
            case, more precisely, the slope formula evaluates
            to
        
            $$ \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0}{0} $$
        
            which could be anything. (Technically, “$0/0$” is
            undefined.) Indeed, infinitely many different
            lines pass through any given point!

            *“Rise over Run”.*
            Some people remember the slope formula as “slope
            equals rise over run” (i.e., “$\te{slope} =$
            |> InlineImage

                width 28px

            ”), following such a picture:

            In this context, note that, in physics, a
            one-dimensional displacement is measured as
        
            $$
            \left({\te{coordinate} \atop \te{at arrival}}\right)\,\, - \,\,\left({\te{coordinate} \atop \te{at start}}\right)
            $$
        
            in accordance, namely, with the coordinate
            differences “$x_2 - x_1\!$”, “$y_2 - y_1\!$”
            that appear in the slope formula.
        
            (In order not to discriminate, maybe we should
            also include this picture:

            Then “rise” and “run” have their signs flipped,
            but the ratio rise-over-run is the same, as
            already mentioned.)

            _An Additional Miscellaneous Notation._
            The slope formula is occasionally written
        
            $$
            \te{slope} = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
            $$
        
            where the foreign-looking symbols $\Delta x$,
            $\Delta y$ can be thought of as shorthands for
            “$x_2 - x_1$”, “$y_2 - y_1$” respectively. (Or,
            a little more exactly, as shorthands for the
            phrases “change in $x$”, “change in $y$”.)

            Multiplying
            $$
            \te{slope} = {\te{rise} \over \te{run}}
            $$
            on each side by “run” gives
        
            $$
            \te{slope} \times \te{run} = \te{rise}
            $$
        
            or “rise equals slope times run”. After which,
            dividing each side by “slope”, we find
        
            $$
            \te{run} = {\te{rise} \over \te{slope}}
            $$
        
            or “run equals rise over slope”. Thus:

            *Slopes and Line Equations.* An equation of the
            form
        
            $$y = ax + b$$
        
            where $a$ and $b$ are constants defines a line in
            the Cartesian plane. E.g.:
        
            |> Image
                src images/49.svg
                width 640px
        
            Note that, assuming said $y = ax + b$, one has
        
            $$y = a\cdot 0 + b = b$$
        
            at $x = 0$, so $b$ is the height of the line at
            $x = 0$. (FYI, this height is called the
        
            __$y$-intercept__
        
            of the line, because $x = 0$ is where the line
            crosses the $y$ axis. But the point
        
            $$(0, b)$$
        
            is also sometimes called the
        
            __$y$-intercept__
        
            of the line, so the term “$y$-intercept” might
            either refer to the value $b$ or to the point
            $(0,b)$, depending.) On the other hand, at
            $x = 1$, we have
        
            $$y = a\cdot 1 + b = a + b$$
        
            so $y$ increases by $a$ between $x = 0$ and
            $x = 1$. In fact, $y$ increases by $a$ each time
            $x$ increases by 1, so, by our own definition of
            slope—the increase in $y$ per unit increase in
            $x$—$a$ is the slope of $y = ax + b$.
        
            |> Example
        
                The equation
        
                $$y = 100x - 3$$
        
                defines a line of slope 100.
        
            On the other hand, an equation of the form
        
            $$y = ax + b$$
        
            cannot describe a vertical line, because $a$ is
            the slope, while a vertical line has no slope, so
            what would $a$ be equal to? Instead, a vertical
            line is described by an equation of the form
        
            $$x = c$$

            (see Fig. 1) where $c \in \rr$ is a constant, 
            similarly to the more familiar equation
        
            $$y = b$$
        
            for a horizontal line, where $b \in \rr$ is a
            constant.
        
            One should also keep in mind that an equation can
            define a line without having either of the forms
            “$y = ax + b$” or “$x = c$”. For example,
        
            $$x + y = 3$$
        
            is equivalent to
        
            $$y = 3 - x$$
        
            and thus describes a line of $y$-intercept $3$
            and slope $-1$.

            *Slopes and Units.*
            If the $x$- and $y$-axes have units then a line's
            slope has units
        
            $$
            {\te{$y$ axis units} \over \te{$x$ axis units}}
            $$
        
            as should make sense, given that the slope is a
            change in $y$ divided by a change in $x$.
        
            For example, if the units on the $y$ axis are
            meters (“m”) and the units on the $x$ axis are
            seconds (“s”) then the slope has units
        
            $$
            {\te{$y$ axis units} \over \te{$x$ axis units}} = {\te{m} \over \te{s}}
            $$
        
            also known as _meters per second_. This is
            precisely the case, for example, in the following
            graph, that purports to plot the height of a
            balloon, in meters, as a function of time elapsed,
            in seconds:
        
            |> Image
                src images/52.svg
                container_classes mt-[1.4em] mb-[1.2em]
        
            The slope of the graph is $0.75$ _meters per
            second_ because the balloon's height increases by
            three _meters_ over the first four _seconds_ (if
            you had noticed):
        
            $$
            \te{slope} \left(\!= {\te{rise} \over \te{run}}\right) = {3\te{m} \over 4\te{s}} = 0.75\te{m}/\te{s}
            $$
        
            In fact, the slope is the balloon's upward
        
            __velocity__
        
            since velocity is defined as
        
            __displacement over time__
        
            and this is precisely the form of the ratio “rise
            over run” for the current graph. (More generally,
            we have
        
            _|“slope = velocity”|_
        
            whenever the $y$ axis has dimensions of length and
            the $x$ axis has dimensions of time—whether the
            slope turns out to be $\te{m}/\te{s}$ or $\te{km}/\te{s}$
            or km/hour, etc, depends on the exact units involved.)
        
            Terminology-wise, slopes are often known as
        
            __rates of change__
        
            in the presence of units. More particularly, in the
            common case when the $x$-axis denotes time, the
            formula

            *Postscript: Units vs Dimensions.*
            Comparing
        
            _|“the $x$-axis has dimensions of time”|_
        
            with
        
            _|“the $x$-axis has units of seconds”|_
        
            one could easily be tricked into thinking that a
            “dimension” is the same thing as a “unit”. In
            fact, dimensions are broader categories, such as,
            namely,
        
            __time__
            __length__
            __mass__
        
            each of which covers _several different_ units.
            For example, in the “time” dimension, one finds
            individual units of the type
        
            __years, seconds, minutes, hours, days__
        
            (etc), while in
            the “length” dimension one finds
        
            __meters, kilometers, millimeters, yards, feet__
        
            (etc), and so on. (You can imagine some of the
            units found in the “mass” dimension, e.g..) On
            the other hand, dimensions can be multiplied and
            divided just like units. For example,
        
            __length over time__
        
            is another dimension, commonly known as...
            velocity!

                    is the slope of the line segment from
                    $(x_0,y_0)$ to $(x,y)$, and it is necessary
                    and sufficient for this segment to have slope
                    $p$ in order for the point $(x,y)$ to be on
                    the line!
        
                    Unfortunately, the equation
        
                    $$ p = {y - y_0 \over x - x_0} $$
        
                    is not an entirely satisfactory answer,
                    because the point $(x,y) = (x_0,y_0)$ itself
                    does not satisfy the equation. (We find
        
                    $$ p = {0 \over 0} $$
        
                    if we plug in $x = x_0$, $y = y_0$, which is
                    not a valid equality because the right-hand
                    side is an undefined quantity.)
        
                    Instead, multiplying
        
                    $$
                    p = {y - y_0 \over x - x_0}
                    $$
        
                    on both sides by $x-x_0$, we find the
                    fraction-less equation
        
                    $$
                    p(x-x_0) = y-y_0
                    $$
        
                    which is satisfied by the point $(x,y) = (x_0,y_0)$
                    as well as by every other point on the line.
                    This can be a final answer, and, pleasingly,
                    has the form

                in the solution to Exercise 2, explain why
        
                $$ y_0 - px_0 $$
        
                is the $y$-intercept of the line of slope $p$
                through the point $(x_0,y_0)$ by using a drawing
                and “rise equals slope times run”.
        
                |> Solution
        
                    E.g.:
        
                    |> Image
                        src images/66.svg
        
                    The rise from the $y$-intercept to $(x_0, y_0)$
                    is $px_0$, as found by “rise equals slope times
                    run”, implying that
        
                    $$
                    y_0 - px_0
                    $$
        
                    is the $y$-intercept.
        
                    |> Pause
        
                    _Note 1._ Our drawing makes some implicit
                    assumptions, such as $p > 0$ and $x_0 > 0$. But
        
                    $$ px_0 $$
        
                    is the rise from the $y$-intercept to
                    $(x_0, y_0)$ regardless of the sign of $p$ or
                    $x_0$ (because $x_0$ is the run in all cases),
                    making
        
                    $$ y_0 - px_0 $$
        
                    the $y$-intercept in all cases.

            *Syntax.*
            A
        
            __function__
        
            is a “rule” for transforming inputs (usually
            numbers) into outputs (usually numbers as well).
            One can think of a function as a box with an
            “input tube” and an “output tube”:
            
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch3_f_box.svg
        
            An input goes in via the input tube, is
            processed according to the function's rule,
            and the result comes out the other side.
            (Metaphorically speaking.)
        
            In the above picture, the name of the function
            is “$f$”.
        
            Notation-wise, one writes
        
            $$
            {f(x)}
            $$
        
            (which is read “$f$ of $x$”, and that's 
            important) for the result of passing an input
            $x$ to a function $f$. For example, if the rule
            according to which $f$ processes inputs is
        
            __the output is the square of the input__
        
            then
        
            $$
            {f(2) = 4}
            $$
        
            [“$f$ of $2$ equals $4$”] because $2^2 = 4$, and
        
            $$
            {f(3) = 9}
            $$
        
            [“$f$ of $3$ equals $9$”] because $3^2 = 9$, and
            
            $$
            { f(0.1) = 0.01}
            $$
        
            [...] because $0.1^2 = 0.01$, and so on. Also,
        
            $$
            {f(x) = x^2}
            $$
        
            [“$f$ of $x$ equals $x^2$”] more generally, which
            is actually the
        
            __definition__
        
            of $f$!! (Stated algebraically.)

            *Lambda functions.*
            A
        
            __lambda function__
        
            is not a type of function, but a type of
            notation  that enables one to define a function 
            without giving it a name, such as “$f$”. In fact 
            there are two different mainstream notations, in 
            this instance. One notation writes
        
            $$
            \lambda{}x.x^2
            $$
        
            to mean “the function that maps $x$ to $x^2$” 
            (and by the way,
        
            $$
            \lambda{}z.z^2
            $$
        
            is _the same_ function, because 
            it specifies the same in-out mapping—a thing 
            goes to its square—also by the way, the symbol
        
            $$
            \Huge \lambda
            $$
        
            is the Greek letter “lambda”, giving its name 
            to the topic) while the other notation writes 
        
            $$
            x \rightarrow x^2
            $$
        
            to mean the same thing.
        
            Note that
        
            $$
            (x \ra x^2)(0.1)
            $$
        
            means “the function that maps each number to its
            square, of $0.1$”. So...
        
            $$
            (x \ra x^2)(0.1) = 0.01
            $$
        
            ...the same as an equation of the form 
            “$f(\dots) = \dots$”.
        
            For more practice:
        
            $$
            (\lambda x.x^3)(10) = 1000
            $$
            $$
            (\lambda u.u^5)(10) = 100000
            $$
            $$
            (v \ra v^2)(10) = 100
            $$
            $$
            (z \ra z^3)(10) + (t \ra t^2)(5) = 1025.
            $$
        
            (Etc.) (Indeed, to emphasize again, the variable 
            denoting the input does not matter: it is just a 
            placeholder, and you obtain the same output, and 
            the same _function_, no matter what symbol 
            you choose.*) (\*As long as you don't collide 
            with other existing variable names.)
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *Definition by cases.*
            Sometimes a function is defined by an expression 
            of the form
            
            $$
            x \ra \begin{cases}
            \ldots & \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \ldots & \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \vdots & \vdots\\
            \ldots & \te{$\ldots$}
            \end{cases}
            $$
            
            where the right-hand side is a list of mutually 
            exclusive cases to consider according to the 
            value of $x$. Equivalently,
            
            $$
            g(x) = \begin{cases}
            \ldots & \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \ldots & \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \vdots & \vdots\\
            \ldots & \te{$\ldots$}
            \end{cases}
            $$
            
            in the case where the function has a name, such
            as “$g$”.
        
            |> Example
        
                If VX-11/78A (don't mind the weird name, chosen
                at random) is the function defined by
                
                $$
                \te{VX-11/78A}(x) = \begin{cases} 
                3.5 & \te{if $x = 0$},\\
                2.5\up{1.1} & \te{if $x = 1$},\\
                \te{undefined}\up{1.1} & \te{if $x \ne 0, 1$}
                \end{cases}
                $$
                
                then
                
                $$
                \te{VX-11/78A}(0) = 3.5,
                $$
                
                and
                
                $$
                \te{VX-11/78A}(1) = 2.5,
                $$
                
                aaand... and these are the only two values of 
                $x$ for which VX-11/78A$(x)$ is defined, as 
                specified.
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *On arbitrariness.*
            While a function such as VX-11/78A might seem 
            completely arbitrary, one lesson from the former 
            example is that functions _can_ be 
            completely arbitrary! In fact, there are only 
            two “ground rules” to respect in order for 
            something to qualify as a function: *(i)* to 
            output
                
            __one__
                
            output per (accepted) input, and *(ii)* to return 
            the
            
            __same__
                
            output each time on the same input. (Sometimes,
            functions are said to be
            
            __deterministic__
                
            because of *(ii)*.)
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *Graphs.*
            The
            
            __graph__
        
            of a function is a visualization device. A point
            on the graph corresponds to an input for which
            the function is defined. The $x$-coordinate of 
            the point is the value of the input, while the 
            $y$-coordinate is the value of the corresponding 
            output.
        
            For example, here is a graph of VX-11/78A:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch3_vx1178A.svg
        
            The graph has only two points, because VX-78/11A 
            is defined at only two values. One point is...
                
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch3_vx1178A_@0_with_cors.svg
        
            ...$(0, 3.5)$, because VX-78/11A maps $0$ to 
            $3.5$, while the other point is...
                
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch3_vx1178A_@1_with_cors.svg
        
            ...$(1, 2.5)$, because VX-78/11A maps $1$ to $2.5$.
        
            |> Example
        
                Here is a graph of $x \ra x^2$ on the interval
                $[-1, 1]$ (meaning: going from $x = -1$ to 
                $x = 1$):
        
                |> Image
                    src images/svg_ch3_x_squared_1_worked.svg
        
                Among all the points on this graph that we 
                could discuss, let us name, say, the point 
                $(0.75, 0.5625)$...
        
                |> Image
                    src images/svg_ch3_x_squared_2_worked.svg
        
                ...which finds itself on the graph, namely, 
                because the square of $0.75$ is 
                $0.5625 = 9/16$.

            $$
            \dom\, f
            $$
        
            —is the set of inputs $x$ for which $f(x)$ is
            defined.
        
            |> Example
        
                We have
        
                $$
                \dom\,\rt{0.1} \te{VX-11/78A} = \left\{ 0\rt{0.1}, 1 \right\}
                $$
        
                because VX-11/78A$(x)$ is only defined at $x = 0$, 
                $1$.
        
            |> Example
        
                If DM-1700 (another weirdly named function) is 
                defined by
                
                $$
                \te{DM-1700}(x) = 
                \begin{cases} 
                0             & \te{if $x \leq 0$ or $x \geq 1$},\\

                $$
                
                then
                
                $$
                \dom\,\rt{0.1} \te{DM-1700} = \rr
                $$
                
                because $\te{DM-1700}(x)$ is defined for all
                $x \in \rr$.
        
            |> Example
        
                If $g : \rr \ra \rr$ (we are going to explain 
                this notation imminently) is the function given 
                by
                
                $$
                g(x) = \sqrt{x - 1^{\color{white}*\!\!}}
                $$

                $$
                
                because the square root of a number is defined 
                if and only if that number is _nonnegative_ 
                (i.e., we need $x - 1 \geq 0$ in order for $g(x)$ 
                to be defined, i.e., we need $x \geq 1$).

            *The Vertical Line Test.*
            As it turns out, the term “graph” just means 
            “set of points in the plane”. So a 
        
            __function graph__
        
            (as described above) is just one particular 
            kind of “graph” among other things that are 
            also called “graphs”, but that are not 
            function graphs.
        
            The so-called
        
            __vertical line test__
        
            observes that a graph [$=$ _set of points 
            in the plane_] is a function graph if and 
            only if every $x$-value (a.k.a., input) 
            corresponds to at most one $y$-value (a.k.a., 
            output). In other words, every vertical line 
            should intersect the graph at most once.
        
            For example, this particular graph...
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch3_wiggle_graph.svg
        
            is a function graph (or locally at least, from
            what we can see), because every vertical line 
            intersects the graph at most once, but this 
            graph...

            ...is not the graph of any function, because 
            some vertical lines intersect the graph more 
            than once.
        
            (Oops. To backtrack and quickly clarify a small 
            matter, an empty circle at the end of a segment, 
            in the vein of the previous figure...

            from the graph. A filled circle, by opposition, 
            means that the point is included!)

            *A Famous Discontinuity.*
            As already seen, functions can have
            _discontinuities_: a place where the function 
            experiences a sudden “jump” in value.
        
            For a famous example of a “naturally” occurring 
            discontinuity (that we feel compelled to 
            mention, for some reason) we need look no 
            further than the function
        
            $$
            \Large x \ra 0^x
            $$
            
            as it so happens that
            
            $$
            0^x = 
            \begin{cases} 0 & \te{if } x > 0\\
            1 & \te{if } x = 0\\
            \te{undefined} & \te{if }x &lt; 0 \end{cases}
            $$
            
            which implies a discontinuity in the graph of
            $y = 0^x$ at $x = 0$, as pictured here:

            is that the former is a
            
            __function__
            
            while the latter is a
            
            __value.__
            
            (Well, provided $x \in \{0, 1\}$, to make it 
            well-defined at all.) Likewise, if $f : \rr \ra \rr$, 
            the difference between 
            
            $$
            f
            $$
            
            and 
            
            $$
            f(x)
            $$
            
            is that the former is a
            
            __function__
            
            while the latter is a
            
            __value.__
            
            Amusingly, though, if we add “$x \ra$” in front 
            of “$f(x)$” then we are back to considering a 
            
            __function__
            
            and which is namely the function whose rule is: 
            apply $f$. In fact,
        
            $$
            f = (x \ra f(x))
            $$
            
            where the above is _an equality between functions_. 
            (You cannot use this equality to
            
            __define__
            
            $f$ because that would lead to a circular 
            definition. But that doesn't make the equality 
            any less true. And btw, you can go “one layer 
            deeper”:
            
            $$
            f = (x \ra f(x)) = (x \ra (t \ra f(t))(x))
            $$
            
            ...where we use the fact that $f = (t \ra f(t))$ 
            in the second equality. You could keep going, 
            replacing each time “$f$” by a self-referential 
            expression, but the process is not intrinsically 
            useful.)

            *Distinguishing “$x^3$” and “$x \ra x^3$”.*
            Technically,
        
            $$
            x^3
            $$
        
            is a _value_ (not a function) and the way 
            logicians think of it, philosophically speaking, 
            is like so: at inception, every symbol has 
            some default value attached, absent any other 
            context.
            
            By contrast,
        
            $$
            x \ra x^3
            $$
            
            is clearly a _function_, not a _value_. 
            So “$x^3$” and “$x \ra x^3$” are very (VERY) 
            different, qualitatively speaking.
            
            But including the arrow everywhere is 
            impractical and even pedantic, so, in the end,
            you might see us refer to an expression such as, 
            e.g.,
            
            $$
            x^3 + x^2
            $$
            
            as a “function”, arrow or no arrow.

            *Polynomials.*
            A function $f$ of the form
            
            $$
            f(x) = a_kx^k + a_{k-1}x^{k-1} + \dots + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0
            $$
            
            is called a _polynomial_. Here
            
            $$
            a_0,\,a_1,\, \ldots,\, a_k \in \rr
            $$
            
            are arbitrary constants, also known as the 
            _coefficients_ of the polynomial. The _degree_ 
            of the polynomial is $k$, if $a_k \ne 0$. 
            (Otherwise, work your way down until you find
            a nonzero coefficient—if there are none, because 
            the polynomial is just the constant $0$, then 
            the degree is _minus infinity_.) (We're not 
            kidding.)
        
            For example,
        
            $$
            2x + \sqrt{2}
            $$
        
            is a polynomial of degree 1, and
        
            $$
            x^2 - 10
            $$
        
            is a polynomial of degree 2, and
        
            $$
            x^{100} + x^{99} + x^{98} + \dots + x^4 + x^3 + x^2 + x + 1
            $$
        
            is a polynomial of degree 100.
        
            Polynomials of low degree have their own 
            special names, as inventoried in the following 
            table:
        
            $$
            \begin{array}{c|c|c}

            \te{5} & \te{quintic} & x^5
            \end{array}
            $$
        
            There is some confusion about the term
                
            __affine__
                
            for which the term
            
            __linear__
        
            is sometimes substituted. But if we say 
            “linear” we mean a function of the form 
        
            $$
            x \ra a_1x
            $$
        
            for a constant $a_1 \in \rr$. This is more 
            restricted than an affine function, because
            there is no constant $a_0$!

            *Quadratic, linear, and constant terms.*
            To finish up on polynomials: the terms of degree
            $2$, $1$ and $0$ are called the _quadratic_, 
            _linear_, and _constant_ terms of the 
            polynomial, respectively. If you see
        
            $$
            a_7x^7 + a_6x^6 + a_5x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 - a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0

            then the quadratic term is $-a_2x^2$, not 
            $a_2x^2$, fyi.
        
            Note that the linear term can also be viewed as
            the “$x^1$ term” while the constant term can
            also be viewed as the “$x^0$ term”; because

                The _floor_ of a real number $x$, written
                
                $$
                \lfloor x \rfloor,
                $$
                
                is the greatest integer less than or equal 
                to $x$. (Start at $x$ and travel left on the 
                number line until you meet an integer; but if
                $x$ is already an integer, stay there; the 
                place you land is $\lfloor x \rfloor$.)
               
                Sketch the graph $y = \floor{x}$.
               
                Secondly, find a formula for a function whose
                graph looks like this, where you are allowed
                to use “$\floor{x}$” in your formula:

                |> Solution
                
                    As $x$ grows, so does $\floor{x}$, but
                    $\floor{x}$ only “levels up” each time $x$
                    reaches a new integer, and “flatlines”
                    otherwise; this gives rise to the following
                    staircase-shaped graph:
        
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch3_floor_graph.svg
        
                    (For example, $\floor{1} = 1$ because the 
                    greatest integer less than or equal to $1$ 
                    is $1$, $\floor{-0.5} = -1$ because the greatest
                    integer less than or equal to $-0.5$ is $-1$,
                    and so on.)
        
                    For the second part note that the following 
                    two displacements, excerpted from the “factory 
                    roof” graph in the statement, are equal:

                        src images/svg_ch3_factory_roof_graph_with_displacement_arrows_worked.svg
        
                    The red dot to the left of $x$ has $x$-coordinate
                    $\floor{x}$, so the horizontal displacement is 
                    $$
                    x - \floor{x}
                    $$
                    so the equation of the graph is 
                    $$
                    y = x - \floor{x}
                    $$
                    because the $y$-coordinate _is_ the 
                    vertical displacement, given that the vertical 
                    displacement starts at $y = 0$, and because
                    the vertical and horizontal displacements are
                    equal.

                Find the formula for a function whose graph 
                looks like this, again using the floor function
                ‘$\lfloor \cdot \rfloor$’ as a building block:

                    We would like to argue the correctness of 
                    the following two-step process (divide the 
                    input by $2$, apply the function from Exercise 
                    4):

                    Indeed, the two graphs featured above differ
                    only by a horizontal dilation; dividing the 
                    input by $2$ “undoes” the dilation, at which 
                    point it suffices to apply the function pictured
                    in the second graph; having declared our method 
                    correct, the answer is thus...
                    $$
                    {x/2 - \lfloor x/2 \rfloor}
                    $$
                    ...as obtained by “sticking” $x/2$ (the halved 
                    input) in place of “$x$” in “$\,x - \lfloor x \rfloor$”,
                    the formula for the function from Exercise 4.

                    In other words, $g$'s output is passed on to $\f$

                    For a formal definition of “$f \circ g$”—something
                    not based on pictures—one need only specify what
                    $f \circ g$ does to inputs. Specifically:
                    $$
                    \,{(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))}.
                    $$
                    (So that equation is a formal definition.) One can
                    also clarify that
                    $$
                    {\dom f \circ g = \{x\, \in\, \dom g:\, g(x)\, \in\, \dom f\}}

                    which is to say that the domain of $f \circ g$

                    exists (a.k.a, “$x \in \dom g$”) and,

                    Consider how to “read off” a value of $y = \cos(1000x)$
                    from the graph $y = \cos(x)$:

                    By the first step, a
        
                    __horizontal dilation by a factor 1000__ 
                    
                    maps the first graph onto the second graph—i.e.,
                    a point
                    $$
                    (x, y)
                    $$
                    is on the first graph if and only the dilated
                    point
                    $$
                    (1000x, y)
                    $$
                    is on the second graph. The first graph is
                    therefore some very compressed thing, full of
                    scrunched bumps!

                    _Note 1._
                    One can also reason that a small change in $x$ 
                    results in a large change in $1000x$, so that 
                    $\cos(1000x)$ must “cycle” much faster through 
                    values than $\cos(x)$ does.

                    Under this representation one can “compute”
                    $f \circ g \circ h$ by gluing arrows end-to-end.
                    First, say, obliviate set $C$ in the middle 
                    right, then do the same with set $B$ in the
                    middle left:

                    We can also get rid of $B$ first, $C$ second:

                    The first order of computation corresponds
                    to the parenthetization “$f \circ (g \circ h)$”
                    while the second corresponds to the 
                    parenthetization “$(f \circ g) \circ h$”.
                    Intuitively, the reason they come out the 
                    same (in “step 6”, bottom left) is because 
                    each final arrow in the last diagram comes 
                    from a path-of-arrows in the original 
                    diagram, and the order in which the 
                    waypoints along a path are “straightened” 
                    (or “collapsed”) does not affect the origin 
                    point or destination point of the final 
                    arrow.

                    The last series of diagrams might leave one 
                    with the impression that the composition of 
                    two or more functions can be “precomputed”
                    by looking ahead along the path of yellow arrows. 
                    Just so you know, computers do not generically 
                    do this. For reason, computers are not given 
                    functions as tables of input-output values to 
                    know by heart but rather as “recipes” (synonyms: 
                    algorithms, code, programs) that allow them 
                    to compute an output for any given input. 
                    Moreover, there is no general way of flattening 
                    two recipes into a single, shorter one—when 
                    composing two functions the computer has, in 
                    general, no choice but to diligently apply 
                    each recipe in order—the first function first,
                    the second function second.

                    _Note 6._
                    We have taken for granted the fact that two 
                    functions $f$ and $g$ are “equal” if and only
                    if they produce the same outupt for every 
                    input but this is a actually subtle thing 
                    that has to do with how functions are defined 
                    “under the hood”. Specifically, mathematicians 
                    view functions as

                        lists of
                    sets of ordered pairs; for example—conceptual
                    cold water shock ahead—
        
                    $$
                    {\textrm{VX-11/78A} = \{(0, 3.5), (1, 2.5)\}}
                    $$
        
                    because VX-11/78A maps $0$ to $3.5$ and maps 
                    $1$ to $2.5$. (The presence of an ordered pair

                    means that input $a$ produces output $b$.) So 
                    two functions are equal if and only if they 
                    are equal
                    
                    __as sets of ordered pairs__
                    
                    because the set of ordered pairs is the 
                    underlying “thing” that the function is. In 
                    particular, there is no notion of a “formula” 
                    or of a “procedure” being attached to a 
                    function, that might cause two functions to 
                    be considered unequal even if they produce the 
                    same output on every input—producing the same

                    $$
                    (x + U)^2 + V = x^2 + 10x + 30
                    $$
                    becomes the equation to satisfy.
                    Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
                    $$
                    x^2 + 2Ux + U^2 + V = x^2 + 10x + 30.
                    $$
                    In order for this equation to hold as an 
                    equality between polynomials (i.e., for all
                    $x$) the coefficients of $x^2$ on both 
                    sides of the equation must be equal, the 
                    coefficients of $x$ on both sides of the
                    equation must be equal, and the constant
                    terms on boths of the equation must be 
                    equal—this gives us
                    $$
                    1 = 1
                    $$
                    (equating the coefficients of $x^2$), and
                    $$
                    2U = 10
                    $$
                    (equating the coefficients of $x$), and 
                    $$
                    U^2 + V = 30
                    $$
                    (equating the constant terms). Only the
                    latter two equations contain information.
                    In particular,
                    $$
                    2U = 10
                    $$
                    implies $U = 5$, so $U^2 + V = 30$ becomes
                    $25 + V = 30$, and 
                    $V = 30 - 25 = 5$.
                    So $U = V = 5$, as previously found.

                    and $25 - 55 = -30$. Passing $55$ to the

                    $$
                    and then write
                    $$
                    {x^2 + {B \over A}x}
                    $$
                    as
                    $$
                    {\Big(x + {B \over 2A}\Big)^2 - {B^2 \over 4A^2}}
                    $$
                    so that, altogether,
                    $$
                    {Ax^2 + Bx}
                    $$
                    is rewritten
                    $$
                    {A\left[\Big(x + {B \over 2A}\Big)^2 - {B^2 \over 4A^2}\right]}
                    $$
                    that can be seen as descending from $y = x^2$ 
                    in three steps:
                    $$
                    {y = x^2}
                    $$
                    $$

                    $$
                    Three steps, three geometric transformations!
                    The third step effects a
        
                    __vertical scaling by $A$__
        
                    i.e., vertically stretches the graph by
                    a factor $A$, because we multiply the
                    value of $y$ by $A$. The second step 
                    effects a
        
                    __vertical translation by ${-{B^2 \over 4A^2}}$__
        
                    i.e., lowers the height of the entire
                    graph by ${B^2 \over 4A^2}$, because we add 
                    $-{B^2 \over 4A^2}$ to the value of $y$.
                    The first step, on the other hand, is
                    entirely different: it is a
        
                    __preprocessing__
        
                    step, in that we mess with the input (i.e., 
                    $x$), instead of adding on (or “multiplying 
                    on”) to the current value of $y$.     
               
                    To understand how a preprocessing step 
                    affects the shape of a graph, note that, more
                    generally, a graph of the form
                    $$
                    {y = f(x + a)}
                    $$
                    (for some constant $a$) “fetches” values on
                    the graph
                    $$
                    {y = f(x)}
                    $$
                    by going $a$ units to the right. The larger $a$
                    is, thus, the further 
                    $$
                    {y = f(x + a)}
                    $$
                    drifts off to the left. For example,
                    $$
                    {y = f(x + 20)}
                    $$
                    has value $f(0)$ at $x = -20$, and if you replace
                    $20$ with something larger, that position (i.e., 
                    $x = -20$) drifts even further off to the left!
                    In any case, the graph $y = f(x + a)$ is the
                
                    __leftward__
        
                    translate by $a$ units of $y = f(x)$
                    and, as a consequence, the first step effects a
                    
                    __leftward translation by ${B\over 2A}$__
                    
                    of the curve $y = x^2$, or
                
                    __horizontal translation by $-{B\over 2A}$__
        
                    more elegantly put. (The second formulation
                    doesn't assume a particular orientation of the 
                    $x$-axis, that's why it's “more elegantly put”,
                    in our opinion.)
               
                    To recapitulate, the three transformations
                    are,in order:
        
                    __1. horizontal translation by $-{B \over 2A}$__
                
                    __2. vertical translation by ${-{B^2 \over 4A^2}}$__
        
                    __3. vertical scaling by $A$__
        
                    |> Pause
        
                    _Note 1._
                    You could do the vertical translation
                    before the horizontal translation,
                    geometrically it comes out the same.
                    That order of geometric transformations 
                    would correspond to the following sequence
                    of algebraic transformations:
                    $$
                    {y = x^2}
                    $$
                    $$
                    {\downarrow}
                    $$
                    $$
                    {y = x^2 - {B^2 \over 4A^2}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    {\downarrow}
                    $$
                    $$
                    {y = \,\Big(x + {B \over 2A}\Big)^2 - {B^2 \over 4A^2}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    {\downarrow}
                    $$
                    $$
                    {y = A\left[\Big(x + {B \over 2A}\Big)^2 - {B^2 \over 4A^2}\right]}
                    $$
                    ...in which the _second_ step is a 
                    preprocessing step. (I.e., a step that 
                    replaces “$x$” with something else.)
        
            |> Exercise
                
                Let $x_0 \in \rr$, $y_0 \in \rr$ and 
                $a \in \rr$ with $y_0 \geq 0$, $a \ne 0.$
                If you apply these transformations...
        
                __1. vertical translation by $-y_0$__
        
                __2. horizontal translation by $x_0$__
        
                __3. vertical scaling by $a$__
        
                ...to the curve $y = x^2$, what are the 
                roots of the final curve that you obtain?
                (Nb: _Roots_ are values of $x$ such 
                that $y = 0$.)
            
                |> Solution
        
                    Start by noting that the point 
                    $(\sqrt{y_0}, y_0)$ is on the curve $y = x^2$,
                    as well as the point $(-\sqrt{y_0}, y_0)$, 
                    because
                    $(\sqrt{y_0})^2 = (-\sqrt{y_0})^2 =$ $y_0;$
                    here is a sketch of the situation before 
                    anything happens:
                
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch3_x0_y0_step0.svg
                        width 760px
                
                    After vertically translating by $-y_0$ 
                    the roots will therefore be at $x = \pm\sqrt{y_0}$:
                
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch3_x0_y0_step1_alone.svg
                        width 760px
                
                    Then after horizontally translating by $x_0$
                    the roots mosey over to $x = x_0\pm\sqrt{y_0}$:
        
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch3_x0_y0_step2_alone.svg
                        width 760px
        
                    Lastly, vertical scaling does not affect 
                    the position of the roots, because it 
                    stretches the graph _about_ the $x$ 
                    axis (here $a \approx 1.7$):
        
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch3_x0_y0_step3_alone.svg
                        width 760px
        
                    So the roots are at: $x = x_0 \pm \sqrt{y_0}$.
                    (Like we found them after the second step.)
        
            |> Exercise
        
                Use the results of the previous two exercises
                to find the value(s) of $x$ such that 
                $Ax^2 + Bx = 0$ for constants $A$, $B$ such 
                that $A \ne 0$.
            
                |> Solution
        
                    Well,
                    $$
                    Ax^2 + Bx = 0
                    $$
                    obviously has solution $x = 0$ to start
                    with, so we _don't need_ the previous 
                    exercises for one of the roots at least—actually,
                    $$
                    Ax^2 + Bx = x(Ax + B)
                    $$
                    so the equation is equivalent to
                    $$
                    x(Ax + B) = 0
                    $$
                    and so one of the roots is 
                    $$
                    x = 0
                    $$
                    and the other root is the value of $x$
                    such that
                    $$
                    Ax + B = 0
                    $$
                    which is $x = -B/A$. (In order for the product
                    $$
                    x(Ax + B)
                    $$
                    to be $0$ you either need the first term to
                    be $0$, leading us to $x = 0$, or the second
                    term to be $0$, leading us to $Ax + B = 0$—the 
                    product of two things is $0$ if and only if
                    one of the two things is $0$.)
                
                    So the roots are $x = 0$ and $x = -B/A$.
                
                    To complete the problem _as we were asked_, 
                    however, we will use the fact that $y = Ax^2 + Bx$
                    is obtained from $y = x^2$ by the following
                    sequence of transformations (cf. Exercise 14):
        
                    __1. vertical translation by $-{B^2 \over 4A^2}$__
        
                    __2. horizontal translation by $-{B \over 2A}$__
        
                    __3. vertical scaling by $A$__
        
                    (We put the vertical translation first.)
                    By Exercise 15, the roots of $y = Ax^2 + Bx$ 
                    are thus at
                    $$
                    \tag{A}
                    x = -{B\over 2A} \pm \sqrt{B^2 \over 4A^2}
                    $$
                    which looks a little different than our 
                    previous result of $x = 0$ and $x = -B/A$
                    until you realize that
                    $$
                    \pm \sqrt{B^2 \over 4A^2} = \pm {B \over 2A}
                    $$
                    (because
                    $$
                    \left({B \over 2A}\right)^{\!2} = {B^2 \over 4A^2}
                    $$
                    and even though ${B\over 2A}$ could be 
                    negative, the “$\pm$” on either side of 
                    the equation means that the _set_ of values
                    on either side of the equation is the same),
                    so that (A) becomes
                    $$
                    x = -{B\over 2A} \pm {B \over 2A}
                    $$
                    and, on the one hand,
                    $$
                    -{B\over 2A} + {B \over 2A} = 0
                    $$
                    while, on the other hand,
                    $$
                    -{B\over 2A} - {B \over 2A} = -{2B\over 2A} = -{B\over A}
                    $$
                    so here too we find that the roots are $x = 0$
                    and $x = -B/A$. (It must be the right answer!)

                    The true statements are i, iv, because
                    $f \circ g$ is the function that maps an 
                    input $x$ to $f(g(x))$, and symmetrically 
                    for $g \circ f$.

                If $f$ and $g$ are functions then we define 
                (and not just us but people in general)
                $$
                f + g
                $$
                to be
                $$
                t \ra f(t) + g(t)
                $$
                (use ‘$x$’ if you like), 
                i.e., to be the function that applies $f$ and
                $g$ separately and then takes the sum,
                and we define 
                $$
                fg
                $$
                to be
                $$
                z \ra f(z)g(z)
                $$
                (use ‘$t$’ if you like, hehe),
                i.e., to be the function that applies $f$ and 
                $g$ separately and then takes the product.
                (These definitions are similar to how we define
                $$
                f \circ g
                $$
                to be
                $$
                u \ra f(g(u))
                $$
                for the symbol “$\circ$”, except that now we 
                are defining the _sum_ and _product_ of functions,
                instead of their _composition_, namely.)
               
                Given these definitions, which of the following
                equalities hold, in general for all functions $f$,
                $g$ and $h$?
                $$f \circ (g + h) = (x \ra f(g(x)) + f(h(x)))$$
                $$f \circ (g + h) = (x \ra f(g(x) + h(x)))$$
                $$(g + h) \circ f = (x \ra h(f(x)) + g(f(x)))$$
                $$(g + h) \circ f = (x \ra (g + h)(f(x)))$$
        
                |> Solution
        
                    The first equality is false because the 
                    right-hand side is actually
                    $$
                    (f \circ g) + (f \circ h)
                    $$
                    not $f \circ (g + h)$; the second equality is
                    true; the third equality is true even though you
                    would expect the right-hand side to be written 
                    $$
                    (x \ra g(f(x)) + h(f(x)))
                    $$
                    with “$g$” and “$h$” switched (but addition is
                    commutative, so it doesn't matter); the fourth
                    equality is true: it is the definition of “$\circ$”.

            *Definitions.*
            The _derivative_ of a function
            
            $$
            f : \rr \ra \rr 
            $$
        
            is a (new) function
            
            $$
            f' : \rr \ra \rr
            $$
            
            that gives the slope of $f$ at each point. 
            In other words
            
            $$
            f'(a)
            $$
            
            is the slope of the graph $y = f(x)$ at
            $x = a$. And—surprise!—each pair of graphs
            above is a pair of the form $y = f(x)$ [$=$
            “before”], $y = f'(x)$ [$=$ “after”]. (Meaning,
            the “after” graph records the slope of the 
            “before” graph.) E.g.:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_explanation1.svg
        
            Note that $f'\!$ (read “$f$ prime”) remains 
            undefined where $y = f(x)$ has a sharp “corner” 
            and no well-defined slope. By opposition, if 
            there is a well-defined tangent line to 
            $y = f(x)$ at $x = a$ the slope of this
            tangent line supplies the value of $f'(a)$:

            In fact,
            we can
            succinctly describe the derivative by...
        
            $$
            f'(a) = \te{[slope of tangent line to $y = f(x)$ at $x = a$]}
            $$
        
            ...with the understanding that $f'(a)$ is 
            undefined if a tangent line does not exist 
            or if the tangent is vertical. But for one 
            last asterisk—and speaking of the existence,
            or not, of the tangent—note that the endpoint
            of a curve does not count as having a tangent,
            and therefore leaves a missing value for the 
            derivative:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_explanation_one_sided_tangent.svg
        
            (In other words, “half-tangents” do not actually 
            count as tangents.) 
    
        |> Section
        
            *Vocabulary.*
            A function $f : \rr \ra \rr$ is
        
            __differentiable__
        
            if $\dom\,f' = \dom\,f$. Also, if $a, b \in \rr$, 
            $a < b$, $f$ is
            
            __differentiable on $[a,b]$__
            
            if $[a,b] \subseteq \dom \,f'$. Lastly, $f$ is
            
            __differentiable at $a$__
            
            if $a \in \dom\,f'$.
        
        |> Section
        
            *Sketching a Derivative.*
            Say that you would like to sketch the derivative
            of the “before” function from the last “before”/“after” pair above
            (the one with the closed endpoints):
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_curve_to_sketch.svg
        
            One method is simply to eyeball the slope at 
            a few points along the curve, plot these 
            values and interpolate:
            
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_first_derivative_sketch.svg
        
            |> ImageRight
                src images/svg_ch4_polaroid_cloud.svg
            
            ...voilà!
            
            An alternate approach is to start by
            determining intervals on which the derivative
            is positive and negative, and then to 
            interpolate via the largest (respectively, 
            smallest) value of the derivative in each 
            interval:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_second_derivative_sketch_pt1.svg
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_second_derivative_sketch_pt2.svg
        
            The result (at bottom right)
            is a charming “robosketch” of the true
            derivative! (Well, charming in our opinion,
            at least.)
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *Derivative of a constant function.*
            A constant function is a function of the form 
            $$
            x \ra B
            $$
            for some $B \in \rr$ independent of $x$.
            The graph of the constant function is the line 
            $$
            y = B
            $$
            of slope $0$. So
        
            $$
            (x \ra B)' = (x \ra 0)
            $$
        
            |> ImageLeft
                src images/svg_ch4_constant_derivative_cloud.svg
        
            because at each $x$-value you find a slope of
            $0$, when you look up (down?) at the graph.
        
            If we refer to
            $$
            x \ra 0
            $$
            as the
        
            __zero function__
        
            we can summarize the situation by saying that
        
            __~ the derivative of a constant function
            is the zero function ~__
            
            or, more shortly,
            
            __~ the derivative of a constant is zero ~__
         
            (the way people usually state it).
    
        
        |> Section
        
            *Derivative of an affine function.*
            An affine function is a function of the form
            $$
            x \ra Ax + B
            $$
            for constants $A$, $B \in \rr$.
            The graph of $x \ra Ax + B$ is a line of 
            slope $A$, so
        
            $$
            (x \ra Ax + B)' = (x \ra A)
            $$
        
            |> ImageLeft
                src images/svg_ch4_affine_derivative_cloud.svg
        
            because the slope of a line of slope $A$ is
            $A$, no matter where you put yourself on the
            line. In particular, $B$ plays no role in the
            derivative! ($\,$Just like in the case of a
            constant function, the derivative leaves no
            trace of $B$'s value—and for the same reason
            that $B$ effects a vertical translation, which
            does not change the slope of anything.)
            
            In words:
            
            __~ the derivative of the affine function 
            $y = ax + b$ is the constant function $y = a$ ~__
        
            Or, flexing our linguistic prowess a tad more:
        
            __~ the derivative of an affine function is 
            the coefficient of its linear term ~__
            
            (The “linear term” of $y = ax + b$ is $ax$, 
            of coefficient $a$.)
        
            |> Example
        
                One has
                $$
                (x \ra 3x + 1)' = (x \ra 3)
                $$
                as per
                $$
                (x \ra Ax + B)' = (x \ra A)
                $$
                with $A = 3$, $B = 1$.
        
            |> Example
        
                One has
                $$
                (x \ra 12 - x)' = (x \ra -1)
                $$
                as per
                $$
                (x \ra Ax + B)' = (x \ra A)
                $$
                with $A = -1$, $B = 12$.
        
        |> Section
        
            *Units of the Derivative.*
            If units are present, we have
            
            $$
            \te{$y$ axis units for $f'$} \,= {\te{$y$ axis units for $\f$} \over \te{$x$ axis units for $\f$}}
            $$
            
            because a value output by $\f'$ is the
            _slope_ of a tangent line attached to the
            graph $y = f(x)$, and
            
            $$
            \te{$x$ axis units for $f'$}\, = \rt{0.02}\,\te{$x$ axis units for $f$}
            $$
            
            because an input for $\f'$ is, originally, 
            an input for $\f$.
        
            For example, if the “before” graph has units 
            of...
        
            |> ul
                |> li
        
                    seconds on the $x$ axis, meters on the 
                    $y$ axis
        
            |> ImageRight
                src images/svg_ch4_units1_cloud.svg
            
            ...then the “after” graph will have units of...
            
            |> ul    
                |> li
        
                    seconds on the $x$ axis, meters per
                    second on the $y$ axis
        
            ...while if the “before” graph has units of...
            
            |> ul
                |> li
        
                    years on the $x$ axis, dollars on the
                    $y$ axis
            
            |> ImageLeft
                src images/svg_ch4_units2_cloud.svg
        
            ...then the “after” graph will have units of...
        
            |> ul
                |> li
        
                    years on the $x$ axis, dollars per
                    year on the $y$ axis
        
            ...and so on.
        
            Units might additionally prompt us to refer
            to $f'$ as the
        
            __rate of change__
            
            of $f$, or, depending, as the
        
            __instantaneous__
        
            rate of change of $f$. The latter bit of
            emphasis has to do with the fact that, in a
            general graph, the slope of the tangent
            keeps changing from point to point.
    
        |> Section
        
            *The second derivative.*
            The _second derivative_ of $f$ is the derivative
            of the derivative of $f$. It is written “$f''$”:
        
            $$
            \,\,\,f'' = (f')'.
            $$
        
            Likewise, we have, e.g.,
        
            $$
            \begin{align}
            \up{0.95}f''' &= (f'')'\\
            \up{1.25}f'''' &= (f''')'\\
            \up{1.25}f''''\psa' &= (f'''')'\\
            \end{align}
            $$
        
            these being, namely, the _third_, _fourth_
            and _fifth_ derivatives of $f$. One can also 
            write
            
            $$
            f^{(n)}
            $$
            
            for the $n$-th derivative of $f$, so that, for
            example,
        
            $$
            f^{(7)}
            $$
        
            means the same as
        
            $$
            f'''''''
            $$
        
            but with the advantage that you don't have to
            squint and start re-counting the apostrophes 
            several times over.
        
            |> Example
        
                We have
        
                $$
                (x \ra 3x + 1)'' = (x \ra 0)
                $$

                    src images/svg_ch4_3x_plus_one_and_second_cloud.svg
        
            because, firstly,
        
            $$
            (x \ra 3x + 1)' = (x \ra 3)
            $$
        
            and, secondly,
        
            $$
            (x \ra 3)' = (x \ra 0)
            $$
        
            so that, from start to finish,
        
            $$
            (x \ra 3x + 1)'' =  ((x \ra 3x + 1)')' = (x \ra 3)' = (x \ra 0)
            $$
        
            where we unpeel the onion starting from the
            inside. (Physically difficult.)

            *Geometric interpretation of the second derivative.*
            The sign of the second derivative—whether
            it is positive or negative—indicates whether
            a graph is “bending upwards” or “bending 
            downwards”. Upward-bending graphs have a positive
            second derivative, whereas downward-bending graphs
            have a negative second derivative:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_ch4_bendiness.svg
        
            Reason like this: the second derivative is 
            |> del
        
                “the rate of change of the rate of change”.
            Sorry: “the rate of change of the slope”. 
            (Same difference.) Ergo, if the second derivative
            is positive, the slope is increasing; if the
            second derivative is negative, the slope is 
            decreasing. Moreover, an
                
            __increasing__
        
            slope gives curves a “bending upwards” shape, while a
        
            __decreasing__
            
            slope gives curves a “bending downward” shape!
            
            To emphasize, if the second derivative is some
        
            _|LARGE POSITIVE NUMBER|_
        
            then the slope is increasing at that rate, 
            which could result in a sharp bend upwards
            in the graph (unless you are near vertical
            already—you can't see the difference between
            slope $100$ and slope $1000$ very well, at most
            scales—nor between $-1000$ and $-100$, for that
            matter).
        
            Likewise, if the second derivative is some
            
            _|LARGE NEGATIVE NUMBER|_
        
            then the slope is decreasing at [the absolute 
            value of] that rate, which could result in 
            a sharp bend downwards in the graph (unless
            you are near vertical already, once again,
            because verticality can disguise the presence
            of a significant change in slope, once again).

            Curves with increasing (technically: 
            _nondecreasing_) slope are called _convex_, 
            while curves with decreasing (technically:

                indicates that the graph
                
                $$
                y = 3x + 1
                $$
                
                is neither “bending upwards” nor “bending 
                downwards”—$0$ is neither positive, nor negative.

            as a function of time.
            
            Note that the units on the $y$ axis of the
            second derivative are given by
        
            $$
            {\te{$y$ axis units for $f'$} \over \te{$x$ axis units for $f'$}} =

            {\te{m} \over \rt{0.1}\te{s}\!{\,}^2}
            $$
        
            because $f'' = (f')'$. The point is, a tangent
            to the graph $y = f'(t)$ has a “rise” measured
            in meters per second and a “run” measured in 
            seconds:
            
            |> Image

            The ratio “rise over run” has the form
        
            $$
            {\te{m}/\te{s} \over \te{s}} 
            = {\te{m} \over \te{s}} \times {1 \over \te{s}}
            = {\te{m} \over \te{s}\!{\,}^2}
            $$
        
            which produces the above-mentioned units of
            the second derivative. Also note that a ratio of
            the form
        
            $$
            {\te{difference in velocity} \over \te{amount of time}}
            $$
        
            is, indeed, an acceleration, in that acceleration
            is defined as “the increase in velocity per unit 
            time”.

            *The Jerk.*
            The rate of change of acceleration has a
            name as well, being known as the
        
            __jerk__
        
            in physics. The units of jerk (or “the”
            units of jerk, since any units of same 
            _dimension_ would do as well) are
        
            $$
            {\te{m} \over \,\te{s}\!{\,}^3}
            $$
        
            or
        
            __meters per second, per second, per second__
        
            which is mildly amusing. Basically, the
            jerk specifies how many _meters per second,
            per second_ (a measure of acceleration!)
            is being gained or lost _per second_.
        
            The word “jerk” is aptly chosen,
            too, considering that people don't lose 
            balance under constant acceleration, but, 
            rather, when some some _jerk_ occurs in 
            the movement of their train or subway car,
            etc. In fact,
        
            __constant acceleration__
        
            and
        
            __zero jerk__
        
            are synonymous, insofar as the everyday 
            world is concerned—which is good, because
            these notions are also equivalent in the
            mathematical realm, what with jerk being
            the derivative of acceleration!

                    The units on the $y$ axis become kilometers,
                    kilometers per hour, and kilometers per
                    hours squared (or “kilometers per hour, per
                    hour”), including the first graph. (Each time
                    another derivative is taken, divide the
                    units of the $y$ axis by the units of the

                    A unit of “$1$” is a
                    
                    __dimensionless__
                    
                    unit. Dimensionless units arise when 
                    quantities are divided by like quantities.
                    Think of dimensionless quantities as “pure 
                    fractions” or “pure ratios”. (Percentages
                    are dimensionless—in fact the term

                    is synonymous with

                    though if you spoke to people about 
                    “dimensionless ratios” they would look at 
                    you funny. Also percentages are a system of
                    notation, whereby the symbol “%” means 
                    “divide the preceding number by 100, in 
                    order to discover the numerical value of 
                    the ratio I'm talking about”.) (To drive
                    it home: In Chinese, the written expressions

                    The graphs are already in the right order 
                    (hehe): if “$f$” is the original function 
                    then $f$ is on the left, $f'$ is in the 
                    middle, and $f''$ is on the right:

                    has a slope that starts at $\sim\!-1$ and
                    ends at $\sim\!1$, while those are the
                    values at which the graph in the middle
                    starts and ends (and not coincidentally,
                    since the graph in the middle is the
                    derivative of the graph on the left!):

                    Moreover the middle graph has slope
                    close to $0$ at either end, and some
                    slope near $1.5$ or $2$ towards the middle,
                    matching the _values_ of the graph

                You don't _need_ the second derivative
                to sketch the first derivative, but if

                |> Solution
            
                    To start with, the slope of $g$ seems to be
                    about $-1.5$, $0$ and (a bit greater than) $2$
                    at $x = -2$, $x = 0$ and $x = 2$ respectively:

                    But the graph of $g''(x)$ indicates more,
                    namely that $g'(x)$ has a slope that rises 
                    from $\approx 0.2$ near the left edge of 
                    the graph up to $1.3$ at $x = 0.5$, before 
                    falling again to $0.6$ past $x = 2$:

                    the slope of $h'(x)$ is near $-1/3$ on an

                    (To achieve a passable slope of $-1/3$ we
                    modeled ourselves on a nearby grid segment.) 
                    Next, $h(x)$ has slope $\approx 1.2$ at
                    $x = -2$, and slope $\approx -0.9$ (?) at
                    $x = 2$:

                    This gives us two more points on the graph
                    $y = h'(x)$:

                    Then, because the second derivative has
                    value $\approx -1/3$ for $x \leq -1.6$
                    (about) and for $x \geq 1.5$ (about)...

                    ...on the relevant intervals. (I.e., for 
                    $x \leq -1.6$ and for $x \geq 1.5$.) The 
                    last step is to join the existing segments 
                    by some kind of “connector curves” of 
                    yet-to-be-determined shape:

                    Since $h''(x)$ shows that the two 
                    connectors have slopes of about $-1/3$
                    at their edges and slopes of about $-1.4$

                If you scale the graph of a function $f$
                vertically by a factor $2$—i.e., multiply
                each output by $2$—is the derivative 
                also scaled by $2$?

                    Yes, this is the case. For a joke way
                    of seeing it, here is a graph of a 
                    putative function $f$, before and after

                    The second graph truly is the first
                    graph vertically scaled by a factor $2$,
                    because the scale on the $y$ axis has
                    been doubled. This means that the ratio
            
                    $$
                    {\te{rise}\over \te{run}}
                    $$
            
                    has doubled in the second graph, because
                    “rise” has doubled (each $y$-coordinate
                    is twice as large!), whereas “run” stays
                    the same. (So the slope of the tangent has
                    doubled, so the derivative is doubled.)

                    [a.k.a., second derivative] is the rate

                    be greatest at the first bend of the curve,

                    As it happens—and by the exact method
                    that we used to generate these curves—the
                    blue is the derivative of the red:

                    Likewise, the derivative of the blue
                    is the yellow, the derivative of the yellow
                    is the green, and the derivative of the 
                    green is the red, at which point it starts
                    all over again! (For example, the 
                    _fifth_ derivative of the red curve
                    is the blue, because the _fourth_
                    derivative of the red curve is itself.)

                    After all, the slope of these curves
                    keeps oscillating between two fixed 
                    values—the “most slanted up” and the 
                    “most slanted down”—so their derivatives
                    were always going to have an oscillatory
                    pattern, as well.

                    _Note 2._
                    Because “most slanted up” occurs when
                    the curve has not yet crested, but when
                    the derivative _is already_ in the
                    process of cresting (that's why it's
                    “most slanted up”), the derivative is
                    ahead of the original curve by half a
                    bump, not the other way around:

                    _Note 3._
                    When we examine the velocity of a
                    particle moving in the plane, we examine
                    the velocities of its shadow on the
                    $x$- and $y$-axes:

                        src images/svg_ch4_cosine_curves_two_dimensional_vel.svg
            
                    The velocities of the two shadows
                    encode the overall “two-dimensional”
                    velocity of the particle. (No need for 
                    quotes, really: the velocity _is_ 
                    two-dimensional.) 
            
                    Here's another point of view: just like
            
                    __position__
                    is encoded by a pair of numbers—sometimes
                    known as the _position vector_ by
                    the way, where “vector” is a term of art
                    for “pair of numbers”—so the
                    
                    __velocity__
                    
                    is encoded by a pair of numbers—equally
                    known as the _velocity vector_—which
                    is no coincidence, because the first
                    coordinate of the
                    
                    __velocity vector__
                    
                    is the derivative of the first coordinate
                    of the
                    
                    __position vector__
                    
                    and likewise for the second coordinate—two
                    coordinates, two rates of change!
            
                    Geometrically, if we use the $x$- and
                    $y$-components $v_x$ and $v_y$ of the 
                    velocity to draw an arrow emanating 
                    from a point on the curve, this arrow
                    is tangent to the curve, and the

                    __length__
                    
                    of the arrow is the
                    
                    __speed__
                    
                    of the particle at that moment in time.
                    More precisely, if you let the particle
                    drift at the exact same $x$- and 
                    $y$-velocities $v_x$ and $v_y$ that you
                    measured at the root of the arrow for
                    one unit of time, the particle would 
                    cover exactly the length of the arrow
                    in that one unit of time, no more no less, 
                    because the particle would cover $v_x$
                    units in $x$ and $v_y$ units in $y$.
                    And speed being
                    
                    __distance per unit time__
                    
                    the length of the arrow is, therefore,
                    the speed!
            
                    Now consider not one but four particles,
                    going around a unit circle in clockwise
                    fashion, 90° apart in phase, at unit 
                    speed (“unit speed” = speed 1, “unit 
                    circle” = radius 1) (ps: We center the
                    circle at the origin):

                    The

                    (You can't really see it so well, but
                    each arrow originates at $(0, 0)$.) While
                    the
            
                    __velocity vectors__

                    velocity vectors keep changing instant by 
                    instant—this is the subtlety of calculus!)
                    The velocity vectors have length $1$ because
                    the speed is $1$, _&_ are brushed
                    in the direction of travel.
            
                    (Nb: When we draw a vector as an arrow
                    we mean that the first coordinate of the
                    vector is equal to the horizontal 
                    displacement from the tail of the arrow
                    to the head of the arrow, and likewise
                    that the second coordinate is equal to the
                    vertical displacement from the tail of the
                    arrow to the head of the arrow.)

                    Due to the 90° rotations and uniform 
                    lengths of $1$, one particle's velocity
                    vector is another particle's position
                    vector; as one example, the red particle's
                    velocity vector is the blue particle's 
                    position vector:

                    From the $x$-coordinates, for example,
            
                    __the velocity in $x$ of the red particle
                    is the position in $x$ of the blue particle__
            
                    at any given moment in time. This also
                    means:
            
                    __the rate of change of the $x$-coordinate
                    of the red particle is the $x$-coordinate
                    of the blue particle__
            
                    ...because “velocity in $x$” is the same
                    as “rate of change of the $x$-coordinate”.
            
                    Concretely, if you graph the
                    $x$-coordinates of the red and blue 
                    particles on the same graph, the rate of
                    change of the red particle's $x$-coordinate
                    will equal the value of the blue particle's
                    $x$-coordinate. These are the reds and blue
                    curves from the problem statement, if we
                    start the red particle at position
            
                    $$
                    (1, 0)
                    $$
            
                    at time $t = 0$:

                    If we add the $x$-coordinates of the green
                    and yellow particles, we find the graph
                    from the problem statement!

                    on the red particle! (In particular, if you
                    wanted to generate the same curves with a
                    counterclockwise rotation, you could do that,
                    but you would have to reverse the order of
                    the particles around the circle to keep the
                    blue particle ahead of the red particle,
                    the yellow particle ahead of the blue

                How can we generate the following set of
                curves by rotating points around a circle,
                and tracking their $x$-coordinates? (This
                graph is an exact $2$&#x200b;$\times$ [“two
                x”] vertical dilation of the graph in Exercise
                12.) Should we use a circle of radius $2$,
                or make the points go twice as fast? Or both?
                Or something else yet?

                |> Solution
            
                    The values oscillate between $+2$ and
                    $-2$, so we need a circle of radius $2$
                    to generate these curves. Also the
                    values go through one cycle in the same 
                    amount of time as the particles of
                    Exercise 12, but the circle has twice the 
                    circumference (having twice the radius),
                    so the particles are going twice as fast!
                    (I.e.: speed 2, since the particles of
                    Exercise 12 have unit speed.)

                    _Note 1._
                    In this and in the previous exercise the
                    units of time and distance are “anonymous”: 
                    distance could be meters, kilometers, or
                    anything, and time could be seconds, hours,
                    etc—it doesn't matter. However, one should
                    be aware that what amounts to
                    
                    __unit speed__
                    
                    under one set of units is no longer “unit
                    speed” under a different set of units—this
                    is not a “physical” property of the 
                    particles, but, rather, a “mathematical”
                    property that holds only for one specific
                    “tweaking” of the units.
            
            
            |> Exercise
            
                Exercise 12 exhibits a function $f$—in fact,
                four different functions $f$—such that
            
                $$
                f' \ne f
                $$
            
                and
            
                $$
                f'' \ne f

                surprise, surprise! Can you do the same with
                “$5$” instead of “$4$”? I.e., find a function
                $f$ such that
            
                $$
                f^{(n)} \ne f
                $$
            
                for $n = 1, 2, 3, 4$ but
            
                $$
                f^{(5)} = f

                |> Solution
            
                    We can naïvely try to imitiate how the
                    curves of Exercise 16 are generated by
                    placing five equally spaced particles
                    around the unit circle (“the” unit circle
                    is the one centered at $(0, 0)$, by
                    convention), instead of 4:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_5_euler_position_vectors.svg
            
                    The idea would be that the
            
                    __velocity vector__
            
                    of the red particle is the
            
                    __position vector__
            
                    of the blue particle, 
                    likewise for the blue and yellow particles,
                    and so on. (Position vectors shown above.)
                    For example, at the instant above, the
                    velocity vectors would be as follows:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_5_euler_velocity_vectors.svg
            
                    The velocity vectors are
            
                    -|NOT|-
            
                    tangent to the unit circle, and so the
                    particles will leave the circle!
                    (But that's OK.) In one-tenth a unit
                    of time, for example, the particles would
                    travel approximately one-tenth their
                    velocity vectors, that would bring them
                    to approximately these new positions:

                    In the next one-tenth unit of time we 
                    can apply a similar approximation again,
                    advancing the particles by ${1\over 10}$th
                    of [the current approximation to] their
                    velocity vectors. Skipping the construction
                    lines:

                    Applying the same process for $8$ more
                    steps:

                    To be clear, in the above figure, the
                    position of the red particle at, say, the
                    fifth step...

                        src images/svg_ch4_5_euler_after_5_10th.svg
            
                    ...is obtained by starting from the red
                    particle's position at the fourth step...
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_5_euler_after_4_10th.svg
            
                    ...and adding one-tenth of the approximation
                    that we have to the red particle's velocity
                    vector at that moment, that approximation
                    being namely the blue particle's position 
                    vector at the fourth step ($t = {4\over 10}$)...

                    ...and we do the same for each particle,
                    to advance to the next step.
            
                    If we stop $10$ times as often,
                    advancing the clock by ${1\over 100}$th of
                    a unit of time at each step, the same figure
                    becomes just a blur (still going from
                    $t = 0$ to $t = 1$):

                    To visualize such a fine-grained
                    approximation we need to revert to drawing
                    the particles as points. In the following
                    figure the colored paths are points that
                    come from a “${1\over 100}$th” approximation,
                    while the orange dots are the old positions
                    obtained from a “${1\over 10}$th”
                    approximation:

                    Zooming in a bit (or else we still can't
                    see anything):

                    In any case, even the “${1\over 100}$th”
                    approximation is just an approximation,
                    but the point is that such approximations
                    do converge to a set of “true” particle
                    paths, as pictured in Fig$.$ 1, that can
                    be computed by some wizards; as time can
                    be played forward or backward, these paths
                    form doubly-infinite spirals—in to infinity,
                    out to infinity.

                    whether or not you are one of the wizards,
                    you can
            
                    __guess__
            
                    the existence of these five paths—sort 
                    of “feel” that they exist! (This is a 
                    moral consolation prize, at least.)
            
                    We can also convert the paths into a 
                    function
            
                    $$

                    that satisfies the problem requirements.
            
                    For example let $f$ be the function that,
                    given a time $t$, outputs the $x$-coordinate

                    There is nothing special about 
                    $x$-coordinates vis-à-vis $y$-coordinates.
                    You can also define $f(t)$ to be, e.g.,
                    the $y$-coordinate of the red particle

                    It is worth noting that, in fact, the 
                    $x$- and $y$-coordinates live separate
                    lives. The rate of change of each 
                    $x$-coordinate is some other $x$-coordinate, 
                    and the rate of change of each $y$-coordinate
                    is some other $y$-coordinate.

                    Adding to this observation, we don't
                    _need_ to start the particles in
                    a symmetric configuration. Symmetry only
                    helps to picture how the positions of the
                    particles will evolve without making any
                    computations. We also don't _need_
                    to work in two dimensions. We can place
                    the particles in a one-dimensional world,
                    e.g., ...

                    matter much, as long as you don't give 
                    all the particles the _same_ initial
                    position, or else you won't have $f \ne f'$
                    etc) and stipulate the same rules, namely
                    that the

                    (now $1$-dimensional) of the blue particle
                    and so on—you can “release” the particles
                    from their initial configuration and
                    simulate (or compute exactly, if you have
                    the know-how) their motion by the same
                    methods as above. The five position
                    functions obtained are each a solution
                    $f$ to the problem. (But this solution will
                    typically look more chaotic than the curves

                    the unit circle, such as these (shown here 
                    with position vectors):

                    Set the velocity of particle
                    $$
                    {\Large 1}
                    $$
                    equal to the position of particle

                    {\Large 5}
                    $$
                    and keep going by this pattern, making the
                    velocity of each particle equal to the
                    position of the particle that is $4$ later;
                    in the configuration above, the velocity
                    vectors end up looking like so, for example:

                    Maintaining this relationship at all 
                    points in time, and given that the velocity 
                    vectors point very slightly outward from
                    the unit circle, and because all the
                    symmetry and all the angles are maintained
                    as we play time forward or backward, the
                    particles spiral gently outward/inward from
                    the circle for time forward/backward,
                    respectively. Taking $f(t)$ to be the $x$- 
                    or $y$-coordinate of any one of the particles
                    (e.g., particle $1$) at time $t$ gives an
                    oscillating function whose $17$th derivative
                    is itself (because the rate of change of
                    the $x$-coordinate of particle $1$ is the
                    $x$-coordinate of particle $5$, etc, until
                    we make it all the way back to particle $1$),
                    and that grows comparatively slowly over
                    time. ~The End~

                    being the position of particle 1, is straight
                    out from the circle! So, as we “start time”,
                    particle 14 will push out from the circle,
                    that will in turn affect particle 10, and
                    so on, until all particles end up being
                    “peeled off” from the circle, in due time;
                    if you are so curious, the particle
                    trajectories end up like so (shown only for
                    $t \geq 0$):

                            which itself starts by going around in
                            a circle, it, too, starts out by going
                            around in a circle!
            
                    (The point is: if your velocity vector 
                    is tracing a circle centered at $(0, 0)$—at 
                    a uniform rate—then you, too, are going
                    around in a circle—it's just that your
                    circle could be centered anywhere, not
                    necessarily at $(0, 0)$!)

                    The pale brown line is sometimes known as
                    the _secant_ [through $(x, f(x))$, $(x+h, f(x+h))$].
                    “Secant” is a general term for “line passing
                    through two specified points on another
                    curve”.

                    If we let $h$ drop to $0$, and if $f$ is
                    differentiable at $x$, the

                    because the secant approaches the tangent,
                    in that case, and the slope of the secant
                    is also, perforce, approaching the slope
                    of the tangent, which is $f'(x)$. (But you
                    cannot directly set $h = 0$, because

            |> Exercise
            
                In this exercise we consider two points
                in time $t_0$ and $t_0 + \Delta{}t$ (here
                “$\Delta{}t$”, read “delta $t$”, is a
                standard notation for a small amount of
                time):

                We also consider quantities $A$ and $B$
                that are changing with time; $A$ and $B$
                have some value at $t_0$, and, say, grow
                to be larger at $t_0 + \Delta{}t$:

                More specifically, we are interested in
                the change in the value of the product

                over said course of time.
                
                To introduce an unsolicited metaphor,
                imagine $A$ and $B$ as
            
                |> Image

                that are crossing a hallway surveyed by
                a cat. One side of the hallway is time
                $t_0$, the other side of the hallway is
                time $t_0 + \Delta{}t$. So great is their
                terror that $A$ and $B$ have decided to 
                scurry across the hallway one at a time.
                First $A$ will go, then $B$. In so, we 
                can separate the following moments of 
                interest (“moments” that exist inside the
                metaphorical timeline of the story, not
                on the $t$-number line, to be clear):

                (and $A$ grows bigger); then as $B$ joins

                If we divide the above equation by $\Delta{}t$
                and let $\Delta{}t$ drop to $0$, what does

                    of time with, therefore, the product $AB$ 
                    also becoming a function of time. (By

                    close we make each term to its respective limit
                    above, one can conclude that

                    where the right-hand-side is _one function
                    times another_, i.e., _a product of functions_,
                    which is something that has ITSELF ALREADY BEEN
                    DEFINED. (!) (To wit, the definition of
                    function multiplication is that
            
                    $$

                    of course.) (Wait we just mentioned that
                    already.) Mathematicians LOVE to bootstrap off
                    an intermediate step, instead of going back to
                    the beginning, so the second way is clearly the
                    superior definition!!

                The definition
                
                $$
                f + g = (x \ra f(x) + f(x))
                $$
                
                for a sum of functions $f, g : \rr \ra \rr$
                can also be written
                
                $$
                (f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
                $$
                
                in the sense that either of these equations tells
                you how $f + g$ acts on an arbitrary input. (Which
                is what you need to do, to define a function. A
                slight subtlety is that the definition
                
                $$
                f + g = (x \ra f(x) + f(x))
                $$
                
                announces more clearly via its notation that 
                “$f + g$” _is a function_ and not some other
                object, like a number, but this is a minor point.)
                Rewrite the definitions of
                
                $$
                f \circ g
                $$

                $$
                f - g
                $$
                
                in the style of the second equation. For extra
                credit: use a different symbol each time to denote
                the input.
            
                |> Solution
            
                    E.g.:
            
                    $$
                    (f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))
                    $$
                    $$
                    (fg)(u) = f(u)g(u)
                    $$
                    $$
                    (f/g)(z) = f(z)/g(z)
                    $$
                    $$
                    (f - g)(t) = f(t) - g(t)
                    $$
            
                    (Looking at these definitions we must really admit that
                    we prefer the first form, with the arrow, found at the

                |> Solution
            
                    We can start with the fraction in the
                    middle of the product:
                    
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_big_product_fraction_outline.svg
                    
                    This is seen to be a Newton quotient
                    (cf. Exercise 16)
                    
                    $$
                    f(x + h) - f(x)\over h
                    $$
                    
                    with $f = A_i$, $x = t_0$, per which
                    (Exercise 16 Note 3), the fraction approaches
                    
                    $$
                    A_i'(t_0)
                    $$
                    
                    as $h$ approaches $0$, given also the assumption 
                    that each of the functions $A_1$, ..., $A_n$ 
                    (including $A_i$) is differentiable at $t_0$.
                    
                    Next down in order of interesting-ness we presumably
                    have the terms $A_1(t_0 + h)$ through $A_{i-1}(t_0 + h)$
                    at the beginning of the product...

                    ...; here the
            
                    __differentiability__
            
                    of $A_1$ at $t_0$ implies the
            
                    __continuity__
            
                    of $A_1$ at $t_0$, which implies that
                    
                    $$
                    A_1(t_0 + h)
                    $$
                    
                    approaches
                    
                    $$
                    A_1(t_0)
                    $$
                    
                    as $h$ approaches $0$. (These various
                    technicalities concerning a generic function
                    $f : \rr \ra \rr$ are mentioned in the solution
                    to Exercise 17.) Similarly for $A_2(t_0 + h)$,
                    etc, up to $A_{i-1}(t_0 + h)$, so
                    
                    $$
                    A_1(t_0 + h) \,\times\, \dots \,\times\, A_{i-1}(t_0 + h)
                    $$
                    
                    approaches
                    
                    $$
                    A_1(t_0) \,\times\, \dots \,\times\, A_{i-1}(t_0)
                    $$
                    
                    as $h$ approaches $0$. (If some quantities are
                    each approaching a different value, then the 
                    product-of-the-quantities will approach the 
                    product-of-the-values—something not mentioned
                    in the solution to Exercise 17, but that might
                    have been.)
            
                    Lastly one has the tail end of the product,
                    where $h$ does not even appear:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_big_product_suffix_outline.svg
            
                    Because $h$ does not appear here, the tail end
            
                    __stays put__
            
                    where it is, irrespective of the value of $h$.
                    So that was easy! Altogether, the answer is
                    therefore:

                    ...with a lone “$A_i'$” in the middle.

                The function below is also the red
                curve from Exercise 12, known as the
                _cosine function_ (already encountered
                in Chapter 3, Exercise 7). Knowing that
                this function is the $x$-coordinate of a
                point rotating at unit speed around a unit
                circle, find, by inspection of the graph,
                a rational approximation to the circumference
                of a unit circle.

                |> Solution
            
                    Because the particle is going at unit speed the
                    circumference of the unit circle is equal to the
                    amount of time it takes the particle to complete one
                    revolution of the circle. That is, for example, the
                    length of this yellow interval:
                    
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_cosine_for_eta_with_yellow.svg
                    
                    One revolution around the circle is also
                    made up of four quarter-revolutions, where
                    each quarter-revolution of the circle is “half a bump”,
                    on the graph:

                        src images/svg_ch4_cosine_for_eta_with_two_yellows.svg
            
                    Going a bit further, _seven_ of these
                    quarter-revolutions appear to take up exactly
                    $t = 11$ units of time (!!!!!!!!!!!) (or maybe
                    just a _little_ less than $11$ units, if
                    you zoom in):

                    Therefore
            
                    $$
                    \Large {11 \over 7}

                    is an approximation to the quarter-circumference of
                    the circle, and
            
                    $$
                    \Large 4 \cdot {11 \over 7} = {44 \over 7}
                    $$
            
                    is an approximation to the circumference of a unit

                    This approximation ends up being about 
                    half-a-part-in-a-thousand too large

                    is about $1.6$, which also appears to agree
                    with what we can see on the graph about the

                    Let's start by examining Pacman's first six displacements,
                    appearing here in blue (positive displacements, going to the right 
                    or up) and red (negative displacements, going to the left or down):

                    We can estimate the duration of each
                    displacement to the closest 10th of a second
                    (mistakes of estimation can be made, we shall recover):

                    We can also estimate the velocity to be
            
                    $$
                    \pm 6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}
                    $$

                    the velocity might seem more like $-6.8\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$ 
                    at the least, but we've already made more
                    significant errors while eyeballing the durations, so
                    nevermind). Using
            
                    $$
                    (\te{velocity}) \times (\te{amount of time}) = (\te{displacement})

                    Given the horizontal/vertical alternation
                    of displacements, this would nominally 
                    imply the following set of initial motions:

                |> Solution
            
                    It seems well-advised to start by heuristically verifying
                    that Pacman's speed remains
                    $$
                    \approx 6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}
                    $$
                    no matter the direction that Pacman is headed, as long as Pacman is
                    in motion.
            
                    For example, take the instant $t \approx 23.7$s, when the 
                    $x$- and <span class="nobreak">$y$-velocities</span> are 
                    both about (?) $4.8\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_at_23_7.svg
            
                    The velocity vector (cf. Exercise 12) is therefore about
            
                    $$
                    (4.8, 4.8)
                    $$
            
                    in units of $\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$ at $t \approx 23.7$s,
                    and the speed, being the length of the velocity
                    vector (cf. Exercise 12), is about
            
                    $$
                    \sqrt{4.8^2 + 4.8^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 4.8 = 6.788...
                    $$

                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_4_point_8_cloud.svg
            
                    (Pythagoras!)
                    in units of $\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$ as well,
                    and
            
                    $$
                    6.788... \approx 6.75
                    $$
            
                    which supports, in this case, the hypothesis that
                    Pacman's speed is $\approx 6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$
                    regardless of the direction of travel.
            
            
                    For more verification, take $t = 26\te{s}$, 
                    at which point the velocity vector is roughly
            
                    $$
                    (6.5, -2)
                    $$

                    This gives a speed of
            
                    $$
                    \sqrt{6.5^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{46.25} = 6.800...
                    $$
            
                    cells per second, Again close to $6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$. (!)
            
                    For two more verifications take $t = 27\te{s}$
                    and $t = 30\te{s}$:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_at_27_and_30.svg
            
                    The speed at $t = 27\te{s}$ is approximately
            
                    $$
                    \sqrt{3^2 + 6.2^2} = \sqrt{47.44} = 6.888
                    $$
            
                    cells per second, while the speed at $t = 30\te{s}$
                    is approximately
            
                    $$
                    \sqrt{5.6^2 + 3.6^2} = \sqrt{44.32} = 6.657
                    $$
            
                    cells per second. Both close-ish to
                    $6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$! For one last
                    verification (truly the last, we promise)
                    consider $t = 31\te{s}$:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_at_31.svg
            
                    This yields a speed of
            
                    $$
                    \sqrt{2.6^2 + 6.2^2} = \sqrt{45.2} = 6.723...
                    $$
            
                    cells per second, again close to $6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$! 
                    (Closest so far, in fact.)
            
                    We now admit, after this “heuristic verification”, 
                    that Pacman goes approximately the same speed
                    regardless of direction, namely something in
                    the vicinity of $6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s}$.
            
                    Now consider the time interval from $t = 22.7\te{s}$ to $t = 24.7\te{s}$:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_first_big_purple.svg
            
                    Both the $x$- and $y$-velocities are nonzero
                    during this interval, which indicates the presence
                    of a curve. The curve starts with vertical motion
                    and ends with horizontal motion:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_first_big_purple_annotations.svg
            
                    Thus Pacman starts the curve going up, and ends the curve
                    going right. Moreover, it takes Pacman
                    
                    $$
                    24.7\te{s} - 22.7\te{s} = 3\te{s}

                    to complete the curve (we know the curve is fully
                    completed from the purely horizontal motion at
                    either end), from which the curve must be
                    approximately
                    
                    $$
                    6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s} \times 3\te{s} = 20.25\te{c}
                    $$
                    
                    in length! In turn, using the approximation
                    
                    $$
                    \approx {11 \over 7}
                    $$
                    
                    for the quarter-circumference of a unit circle
                    (cf$.$ Exercise 24), this would indicate that
                    the curve (which is a quarter-circle, as 
                    all curves in this maze) has radius
                    
                    $$
                    \approx {20.25\te{c} \over 11/7} = {7 \times 20.25\te{c} \over 11} = {141.75\te{c} \over 11} = 12.886...\te{c}
                    $$
                    
                    where we give up and use a calculator at the
                    last step. But the possible radii are $3$, $6$,
                    $9$ and $12$. This all but rules out all of the
                    maze curves except the one that has radius $12$,
                    and that allows a traversal that starts upward
                    and ends rightward; we mean the upper left
                    curve of the maze:

                    From there, Pacman goes right for a bit, then
                    takes another curve 3 seconds long, that starts
                    rightward and ends downward:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_second_big_purple.svg
            
                    ...this second curve must, of course, be the
                    upper right-hand corner of the maze, that has the
                    appropriate length, position, and orientation:

                    What is extremely strange, however, is that
                    Pacman immediately follows the end of this curve
                    with rightward motion:

                    In fact, it is also strange that Pacman _preceded_
                    the first curve with rightward motion (when that curve
                    starts at the leftmost edge of the maze):

                    Looking back over our work, 
                    we find that we made a mistake when we wrote
            
                    $$
                    24.7\te{s} - 22.7\te{s} = 3\te{s}
                    $$
            
                    the corrected version of that being of course
            
                    $$
                    24.7\te{s} - 22.7\te{s} = 2\te{s}
                    $$
            
                    (the second curve likewise lasted $2\te{s}$,
                    not $3\te{s}$) making the length and radius of
                    the first curve two-thirds of whatever we previously 
                    computed (because $2\te{s}$ is two-thirds of
                    $3\te{s}$), i.e.,
                    
                    $$
                    {2 \over 3} \times 12.886...\te{c}
                    $$
                    
                    for the _radius_ of the first (and second)
                    curve, which means that the first and second curves
                    actually had radii $9$, undoubtedly,
                    and that Pacman's initial motion followed the 
                    one-inside track (the two rightward motions are 
                    easily seen to be ~$3\te{c}$ each):

                    Next, after some downward motion we are faced
                    with a long, juicy, down-and-then-left curve,
                    which must surely be the bottom-right curve of
                    radius $12$:

                    Indeed, the curve lasts ~$2.7$s, and 
                    
                    $$
                    6.75\te{c}\hlfbk/\hlfbk\te{s} \times 2.7\te{s} = 18.225\te{c}
                    $$
                    
                    is approximately the same as 
                    
                    $$
                    {11 \over 7} \cdot 12\te{c} = 18.85...\te{c}
                    $$
                    
                    confirming the radius of $12\te{c}$ and the location
                    of the curve.
                    Pacman's trajectory so far is then:

                    Next Pacman seems to reverse course, and briefly
                    re-enters the curve (going right and up a tiny bit):
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_back_in_purple.svg
            
                    But then changes again, and re-exits the curve
                    (going left and down a tiny bit):
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_back_out_purple.svg
            
                    Then Pacman goes left-and-then-right-again by
                    some small amount:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_pacman2_frankenstein_back_out_purple.svg
            
                    At this point—and in particular at 
                    $t = 34\te{s}$—Pacman is between a moment 
                    of purely horizontal motion and purely vertical
                    motion; since the left-and-then-right-again 
                    motion did obviously not bring Pacman $3$ cells
                    over to the left (which is the next place 
                    after the curve exit that is connected to both 
                    horizontal and vertical paths),
                    Pacman must 
                    be at the bottom-left exit of the bottom-right
                    maze corner, still.

            |> Exercise
            
                Describe what a function might look like
                if its second derivative has this graph (broadly):
            
                |> Image
                    src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line.svg
            
                |> Solution
            
                    As the second derivative is the
            
                    __rate of change of the slope__
            
                    places where the second derivative is zero are 
                    places where the slope of the function is constant.
                    So the function will have a constant slope over
                    each of these purple intervals (we're going to
                    assume that what looks like $0$ is $0$, and eyeball 
                    where that starts and ends, the statement
                    does say “broadly” anyway):
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_with_purple.svg
            
                    As
            
                    __constant slope__
            
                    means
            
                    __line segment__
            
                    the function will therefore be a 
                    line segment, over each of the purple intervals!
            
                    Between these line segments, however, things
                    happen, and there is a change in slope! The
                    change in slope is given by the “amount of bump”
                    in the second derivative between the intervals.
                    As it turns out, the area enclosed by the bump
                    gives the total change in slope:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_positive_area.svg
            
                    (We won't argue this right now, but it's 
                    sort-of-intuitive.)
                    For bumps lying below the $x$-axis the area
                    counts as negative; that negative area is, again,
                    the total change in slope from one end of the bump
                    to the other:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_negative_area.svg
            
                    In any case the areas are all the same _in absolute
                    value_, meaning that whatever slope is gained as
                    we pass over a positive bump, the same amount
                    is lost again as we pass over a negative bump!
                    Thus, the line segments of the original function
                    will alternate between “low” and “high”
                    slopes—as we pass over a positive bump we switch
                    from a “low slope” line segment to a “high slope”
                    line segment, and vice-versa when we pass over a
                    negative bump.
            
                    Put 
            
                    $$
                    \Large a
                    $$
            
                    for the area of a positive bump (per appearances, 
                    $a \approx 1$), and
                    
                    |> ImageRight
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_a_is_about_1_cloud.svg
            
                    $$
                    \Large c
                    $$
            
                    for the slope of a “low slope” line segment. Then a
                    “high slope” line segment has slope 
            
                    $$
                    \Large c + a
                    $$
            
                    since we add $a$ to the slope each time we go over
                    a positive bump. 
                    (And the slope goes back down to
            
                    $$
                    \Large (c + a) + (-a) = c
                    $$
            
                    when we pass over a negative bump, with $-a$ being
                    the (negative) area of a negative bump.)
            
                    With these variables in place, here is a generic
                    illustration of a graph (in black) whose second
                    derivative is the one from the statement (faded in
                    the background):
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_solution_sketch_1.svg
            
                    |> ImageLeft
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_c_is_approx_0_point_2_cloud.svg
            
                    In this example $c \approx 0.2$, but $c$ can be any
                    value—this is not constrained by the second derivative.
                    Moreover any amount of vertical translation can 
                    also be introduced to the graph. (Vertical
                    translation does not affect the derivative,
                    much less the second derivative.)
            
                    For another example, if $c = -a/2$,
                    meaning $c \approx -1/2$,
                    the graph ends up a perfectly balanced see-saw that 
                    stays confined to a bounded range of $y$-values:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_solution_sketch_2.svg
            
                    |> ImageLeft
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_c_is_approx_minus_a_over_2_cloud.svg
            
                    Moreover, like the previous graph, this solution
                    can also be vertically translated by any amount!
                    (And same for any solution.)
            
                    For yet another example, here is a graph in which
                    $c + a = 0$, $c = -a \approx -1$:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_solution_sketch_3.svg
            
                    Again, any of these graphs are
            
                    __equally valid__
            
                    solutions, and, for the last time,
            
                    __any amount of vertical translation can be introduced__
            
                    (you can move the graphs up and down). So in
                    other words we have a “two-parameter family of
                    solutions”: one parameter of the solution—free
                    to choose—is $c$—while another parameter—independently
                    free to choose—is the amount of vertical
                    translation.
            
                    To claim a truly good “theoretical” understanding
                    of the solution, however, we should also determine
                    this rise here, if we can, as a function of $c$
                    and $a$, i.e., the amount of rise between the end
                    of one line segment and the start of the next:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_what_are_the_rises_1.svg
            
                    In fact, is not entirely clear that there aren't
                    possibly _two different_ values of this rise,
                    for the two different kinds of “connector curves”
                    that exist (the concave ones and the convex ones):
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_what_are_the_rises_2.svg
            
                    (It will turn out that 
                    the rises are all the same
                    but we're just pointing out.)
                    Focusing on the case
                    of a convex connector curve, note 
                    that the rise is lower bounded by
                    $$
                    \Large 1.6c
                    $$
                    where $1.6 = 0.8 + 0.8$ is the length (run) of
                    the connector curve, because $c$ is the _lowest 
                    slope_ found anywhere inside the connector
                    curve:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_connector_curve_lower_bound.svg
            
                    Symmetrically,
            
                    $$
                    \Large 1.6(c + a)
                    $$
            
                    is an upper bound on the rise, because $c + a$ is the
                    _greatest slope_ anywhere inside the
                    connector curve:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_connector_curve_upper_bound.svg
            
                    To go any further we must add the first
                    derivative to this sketch—the first derivative
                    has value
                    $$
                    \Large c
                    $$
                    where the function has slope $c$, has value
                    $$
                    \Large c + a
                    $$
                    where the function has slope $c + a$, and
                    climbs up/down along an S-shaped curve outside
                    of those intervals, adhering
                    to a slope that is given by the value of the
                    second derivative: 
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_what_are_the_rises_3.svg
            
                    The afore-mentioned lower bound of 
            
                    $$
                    \Large 1.6c
                    $$
            
                    coincides with the area of a rectangle that _lies
                    below_ the graph of the derivative:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_connector_curve_lower_bound_area.svg
            
                    Whereas the afore-mentioned upper bound of 
                
                    $$
                    \Large 1.6(a + c)
                    $$
            
                    coincides with the area of a rectangle that
                    _lies above_ the graph of the derivative:

                        src images/svg_ch4_one_long_line_connector_curve_upper_bound_area.svg
            
                    In other words, the rise of the convex connector
                    curve is lower and upper bounded by these
                    two areas. It will be helpful to write this
                    as a pictorial inequality:

                    But we can tighten the inequality by dividing the
                    areas halfway (we'll let you think about this 
                    one—if you don't get it, don't worry, because we'll
                    revisit the same topic in detail at some point):

                    And because the S-curve is centrally symmetric
                    (the slopes at equal distance from the center are
                    the same because those slopes can be read off the
                    second derivative, and the second derivative bump
                    is left-right symmetric) we can compute the area
                    that the curve encloses exactly, by a geometric
                    surgery:

                    Long story short, the area enclosed, which is
                    also the rise of the connector curve, is

                    ...that can be read as “run times average slope”
                    (because
                    
                    $$

                    is the run while the slope (first derivative)
                    spends equal amounts of time, in equal measure,
                    above and below the value

                    that is, indeed, the average of $c$ and $c + a$).
                    For concave connector curves the

                    high to low, but the area enclosed by the S-curve
                    is the same. This area is also the rise of the
                    connector curve. Hence, long story short—for the
                    second time—all connector curves have rise

                    is the same as
                    
                    $$
                    (f(gh))(u)

                    for an arbitrary input $u \in \rr$, in order to
                    show that 
                    
                    $$
                    (fg)h

                    are the same function. (Function equality is
                    based on input-output behavior: two functions are
                    equal if and only if every input is mapped to the
                    same output under either function. See Note 6,
                    Exercise 9, Chapter 3.)
            
                    Starting up,
                    
                    $$

                    by the definition of function multiplication,
                    and
                    
                    $$
                    (f(gh))(u) = f(u) \cdot (gh)(u)
                    $$
                    
                    likewise. Moreover,
                    
                    $$
                    (fg)(u) = f(u) \cdot g(u)

                    by the same definition again. Therefore,
                    
                    $$
                    ((fg)h)(u) = (f(u) \cdot g(u)) \cdot h(u)

                    on the one hand, and
                    
                    $$
                    (f(gh))(u) = f(u) \cdot (g(u) \cdot h(u))

                    on the other hand. But
                    
                    $$
                    (f(u) \cdot g(u)) \cdot h(u) = f(u) \cdot (g(u) \cdot h(u))
                    $$
                    
                    by the associativity of ordinary real number
                    multiplication. (Not function multiplication:
                    _real number multiplication_.) So
                    
                    $$
                    ((fg)h)(u)
                    $$
                    
                    equals

                    for arbitrary $u$, which completes the proof.

                    for all real numbers $a$, $b$, mentioned in the

                    for arbitrary $u\in \rr$, where the first and
                    last equality are by the definition of a
                    product of functions and where
                    the middle equality is by commutativity of real
                    number multiplication. [That would be the fact that

                    Moreover at $t = 2$s the rat 
                    has reached
                    $2 \cdot (5/3) = 10/3 = 3.\overline{33}$m,
                    where the dollars-per-meter earnings
                    rate is one-tenth of a dollar per meter, by

                    $$
                    
                    because—to come back to the example of the 
                    fundraising race—one must multiply the meters-per-second
                    velocity at time $t$ (that is, $g'(t)$) by the dollars-per-meter 
                    earnings rate at position $g(t)$ (that is, $f'(g(t))$) to obtain
                    the final dollars-per-second earning rate at time $t$
                    (that is, $(f \circ g)'(t)$).
            
                    (For example, the solution to Exercise 36 can actually
                    be written
                    
                    $$

                    $$
                    
                    since, indeed, $g(2) = 3.333...$. [Remember that we ended
                    up multiplying $g'(2) = {5\over 3}\te{m/s}$ by 
                    $f'(3.333...) = {1\over 10}\te{\$/s}$—the “$3.333...$” is
                    $g(2)$.])

                going at three times unit speed (“speed $3$” in common
                parlance) clockwise around a circle of radius $2$.
                What path does the velocity vector describe 
                over time? (I.e., if you cut-paste the velocity
                vector back to the origin, so that its “tail” 
                is at $(0, 0)$, what curve does the far end of the
                vector describe?) Over how much time?
            
                |> Solution
            
                    The velocity vector is an arrow of length $3$
                    tangent to a circle of radius $2$, brushed
                    clockwise:

                    If we bring the tail of the vector back to
                    $(0, 0)$ we find an arrow of length $3$

                    Lastly, the velocity vector does a full revolution
                    of the red circle in the same amount of time that
                    the particle does a full revolution of the blue circle,
                    which is

                    {2\cdot (\te{circumference of a unit circle}) \over \te{3}}
                    $$
            
                    because the circumference of the blue circle
                    is twice the circumference of a unit circle,
                    and the particle is going at speed $3$.

                    travels around a circle of radius $2$.
                    The speed of the velocity vector is therefore
                    $1.5$ times the speed of the position vector,
                    or $1.5 \times 3 = 4.5$.
            
                    As the derivative of the velocity vector,
                    the acceleration vector is therefore
                    a vector of length $4.5$ (= the speed of the 
                    velocity vector) brushed clockwise along 
                    the path of the velocity vector:

                    Or, if we translate the acceleration vector back 
                    to the origin and trace out its path over time 
                    (either way is fine):

                    _Note 1._
                    You truly have to think of the acceleration
                    vector as “the velocity of the velocity 
                    vector”—if the velocity vector is changing, the
                    acceleration vector is nonzero!
            
            |> Exercise
            
                Sketch the velocity vector, acceleration vector,
                and jerk vector of a particle going around a circle
                of radius $3$ at speed $2$. (Clockwise, say.)
            
                |> Solution
            
                    The velocity vector has length $2$, because the
                    particle has speed $2$. So the velocity vector
                    looks like so, while attached to the particle path
                    (top) or brought back to the origin (bottom):
            
                    |> Image

                    Moreover (!) the speed of the velocity vector is 
                    $2/3$ the speed of the particle, because the 
                    velocity vector goes around a circle of $2/3$ the 
                    radius in the same amount of time. So the velocity 
                    vector has speed
                    
                    $$
                    \Large 2 \cdot {2\over 3} = {4\over 3}
                    $$
                    
                    from which the acceleration vector—that can be 
                    described as “the velocity vector of the velocity
                    vector”—has length ${4\over 3}$ (the speed of the
                    velocity vector), and looks like so (in either representation):
            
                    |> Image

                    Lastly the acceleration vector has speed
                    
                    $$
                    \Large {4\over 3}\cdot {2\over 3} = {8 \over 9}
                    $$
                    
                    by virtue of circling a circle of radius $2/3$ 
                    that of the velocity vector, that has speed $4/3$, 
                    in the same amount of time. Since the jerk is the
                    derivative of the acceleration, this becomes the
                    length of the jerk vector, that is exactly opposite
                    to the velocity vector, being twice $90^\circ$ away:

                ever reach $x = 0$? 
            
                |> Solution
            
                    Going back in time,
                    examine how long it would take
                    the particle to cross each of the intervals defined by
                    the following geometric progression* (*see Note 1):

                    The interval from $0.5$ to $1$
                    takes _at least_
            
                    $$
                    {0.5 \over 1} = 0.5

                    inside of that interval is $1$.
                    Similarly, the interval from 
                    
                    $$
                    x = 0.25
                    $$
                    
                    to
                    
                    $$
                    x = 0.5
                    $$
                    
                    takes _at least_
                    
                    $$
                    {0.25 \over 0.5} = 0.5

                    time to cross, because the maximum speed of the particle
                    inside of that interval is $0.5$!
                    And, again, the interval from 
                    
                    $$
                    x = 0.125

                    takes at least
                    
                    $$
                    {0.125 \over 0.25} = 0.5
                    $$
                    
                    time to cross, because the maximum speed of the particle
                    inside of that interval is $0.25$. Etc—each interval 
                    takes _at least_
                    
                    $$
                    0.5

                    units of time to cross, because the length of each
                    interval is half of the maximum speed within the interval!
                    But there are infinitely many intervals, and, therefore,
                    it takes
                    
                    __at least__
                    
                    infinitely much time to make it to $x = 0$, where the
                    “infinitely” comes from adding infinitely many $0.5$'s
                    together! (In other words, the particle never makes it to
                    $x = 0$, no matter how far back in time you look.)
            
                    A so-called
            
                    __geometric progression__
                    
                    is a sequence of numbers in which each number
                    is a fixed multiple of the previous number.
                    For example,
                    
                    $$
                    100,\, 300,\, 900,\, 2700
                    $$
                    
                    is a (finite) geometric progression, because each number
                    is the previous number multiplied by $3$,
                    and
                    
                    $$
                    1,\, 0.5,\, 0.25,\, 0.125,\, 0.0625,\, \ldots
                    $$
                    
                    is an (infinite) geometric progression, because each number
                    is the previous multiplied by $0.5$.

                Take a system of two particles on the real
                line; at time $t = 0$, the first particle (yellow)
                is at $x = -1$, while the second one (blue)
                is at $x = 1$:

                If the velocity of the yellow particle is set to track
                the position of the blue particle and vice-versa, 
                give a qualitative sketch of the
                position-as-a-function-of-time (time on the $x$
                axis, position on the $y$ axis) of the two 
                particles. If we add also the graph of the position
                of the red particle from Exercise 41 to this set of
                graphs, what symmetries
                exist altogether between the three graphs?
            
                |> Solution
            
                    For $t > 0$ the yellow and blue particles
                    approach $0$ in a kind of “radioactive decay”
                    pattern; for $t < 0$,
                    they spin
                    off to $-\infty$ and $\infty$ respectively at an
                    accelerating rate:

                        src images/svg_ch4_three_one_dimensional_particles_blue_yellow.svg
            
                    If we add the graph of the red particle to the
                    mix, it is simply the mirror image of the
                    blue particle's position through the $y$ axis
                    ($y$ axis that is ironically labeled “$x$”):

                        src images/svg_ch4_three_one_dimensional_particles_blue_yellow_red.svg
            
                    Indeed, for the red graph,
            
                    __the slope equals the $y$-value__
            
                    (velocity = position), while
            
                    __the slope equals minus the $y$-value__
            
                    for the blue graph (velocity = position
                    of yellow = minus own position). 
                    (We forgot to mention that the blue and
                    yellow graphs are mirror images of one another
                    through the horizontal axis—this is one of the 
                    “symmetries” that the problem statement asks about, though.)
                    As taking a mirror image through the $y$ axis
                    negates slopes without affecting $y$-coordinates,
                    while both the blue and red graphs have the same
                    value at $t = 0$, this explains why the mirror
                    image of one graph fits the constraints of the other
                    and vice-versa:

                    Also note that all graphs have slopes of
                    $
                    \pm 1
                    $
                    at $t = 0$, as we tried to reflect in the sketches, 
                    because each corresponding particle position 
                    is either $1$ or $-1$.

                If the configuration above shows time

                    At $t = 0$
                    the particles have position vectors that
                    are up and the right,
                    so the velocity vectors will be
                    up and to the right,
                    so the particles will move more up and
                    to the right, and the velocity vectors
                    will become more “up and to the right”, 
                    and so on—broadly speaking, for $t > 0$
                    there will ensue
                    a kind of 
                    four-particle explosion
                    that goes up and to the right,
                    off to $(+\infty, +\infty)$.

                    For $t < 0$ motion will be
                    down and to the left, at least initially—it
                    is hard to forecast off the top of one's
                    head (unless you have a sudden flash of insight)
                    what will happen for larger negative
                    values of $t$.
            
                    HOWEVER.
            
                    It is possible to say much more.
            
                    To go deeper, we introduce eight new
                    particles, comprising the original colors but
                    in white and black flavors:

                    At $t = 0$ the white particles are just a
                    translate of the original particles, such
                    that the circle on which they lie is 
                    centered at $(0, 0)$:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_circle_at_2_4_white_version.svg
                    
                    The black particles, for their part, are
                    piled on top of one another at $(x, y) = (2, 4)$ at $t = 0$, 
                    that we draw as four quarter-pies
                    of different colors, like a UNO card:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_circle_at_2_4_black_version.svg
            
                    Within each group we set the velocity of
                    the purple particle to the position of the
                    yellow particle, 
                    the velocity of the yellow particle to the
                    position of the green particle, and so on,
                    like for the original set of particles.
            
                    In this case the white particles will
                    rotate at unit speed around their circle of
                    radius $1$ centered at the origin, just like
                    the particles discussed in the solution to
                    Exercise 12, that obey a similar set of
                    constraints
                    (albeit with a different set of colors). 
            
                    The black particles, for their part, 
                    behave as a single fused-together particle
                    whose velocity is equal to its position,
                    and will
                    see their motion confined to an infinite 
                    half-line through
                    $(0, 0)$ and $(2, 4)$, as their velocity—being
                    equal to their position—stays parallel to the
                    line between them and the origin, meaning
                    they are “stuck” to that line.
            
                    Also note that the
            
                    __speed__
            
                    of the black particles, being equal to the
            
                    __length of the velocity vector__
            
                    of said particles, is equal to the
            
                    __length of the position vector__
            
                    |> ImageRight
                        src images/svg_ch4_circle_at_2_4_position_equals_velocity_cloud.svg
            
                    of said particles, is equal to the
            
                    __distance to the origin__
            
                    of said particles,
                    since the length of the position vector is
                    the distance to the origin.
            
                    This means that if we introduce gradations
                    to the afore-mentioned half-line through $(0, 0)$
                    and $(2, 4)$...

                    ...indicating the distance to the origin,
                    the black particles behave like a 
                    one-dimensional system comprising a single
                    particle on a half-line (or entire line,
                    it doesn't hurt) whose velocity is equal to
                    its position on this line:
            
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_circle_at_2_4_UNO_flat_half_line.svg
                    
                    The behavior of such a particle is
                    identical to the behavior of the red
                    particle from Exercise 41, 
                    except that the current
                    “UNO particle” has a slight head-start over the
                    red particle from Exercise 41, being
                    at position $x = 2\sqrt{5}$ 
                    instead of at position $x = 1$ at $t = 0$.
                    (!!)

                    This describes an “understandable”
                    behavior of the black and white particles.
            
                    Next we write

                    the $x$-coordinate of the purple-white particle

                    to emphasize that WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A FUNCTION, e.g.,

                    is the $x$-coordinate of 
                    the purple-white particle at
                    $t = 2$, etc), and write

                        $_y$
            
                    for the function that gives
                    the $y$-coordinate of the purple-white 
                    particle as a function of time, and so on 
                    for all the other particles.
            
                    For example,

                    is the value of the $x$-coordinate

                    of the problem! (We momentarily have two different
                    purple particles: the one from the problem statement, 
                    and the one that we have just defined; but that's ok,
                    as long as we are aware of this small semantic
                    transgression, it is not such a big deal, 
                    and we shall soon prove that these two
                    particles are one and the same.)

                    of the problem statement, and are, indeed, the
                    solution we seek.
            
                    Qualitatively, this implies that the particles
                    can be understood as four particles rotating at 
                    unit speed around a circle of radius $1$ (the 
                    white particles) where the center of circle (the 
                    UNO particle) is moving at exponential rate along
                    a half-line. In particular, the particles remain
                    at constant distance from one another for all $t$,
                    whether that seems intuitive or not.
            
                    Concretely, 
                    the particle trajectories
                    end up like so, locally around $t = 0$:
                    
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_ch4_circle_at_2_4_solution_curves.svg
                    
                    The above plot goes from $t = -5$ to 
                    $t \approx 1$—winding further back in time would produce
                    near-perfect counterclockwise circular motion,
                    as the black particles rush up to $(0, 0)$
                    and come to a near-halt rather fast,
                    leaving only the residual motion of the white
                    particles!
            
                    _Note 1._
                    When we said that, for $t > 0$, there ensues
                    
                    -|“a [kind of] four-particle explosion”|-
                    
                    in the first paragraph of the solution, the word 
                    “explosion” might be misleading, implying increased
                    distances between the particles over time. This is
                    not the case! (But we didn't know any better, back
                    then.)

                    As you might already have caught on, but is
                    maybe worth emphasizing,

                    The blue curve is the derivative of the red curve
                    but is also the horizontal translate of the red curve by
                    $a$ units to the left, where

                    is the distance between adjacent bumps. Thus if

                    $f$ and constant $a \in \rr$, as discussed

            *Notation.*
            Curly braces typically denote the beginning
            “$\{$” and ending “$\}$” of a collection of 
            elements, otherwise known as a _set_.
            For example, this is a set containing the 
            numbers $1$, $2$ and $3$ (and nothing else):
            
            $$\Large\{1, 2, 3\}$$
        
            Also,
        
            $$\Large\{1\}$$
        
            is a set containing just the number $1$, while
            
            $$\Large\{1, 3\}$$
            
            is a set containing just the numbers $1$ 
            and $3$, etc. Even,
            
            $$\Large\{\}$$
            
            is an _empty_ set, a set with no elements!

            *What it does.*
            The “API” (a computer science notion,
            roughly meaning
            
            __the interface offered to the outside world__
        
            as in, for example, the buttons and clock 
            display and door handle of a microwave oven) 
            of a set consists of just one functionality: 
            a set can answer questions of the form
        
            __do you contain ... ?__
        
            and nothing else.
            For example, you could ask a set
        
            __do you contain 3?__
        
            to which $\{1, 3\}$ would answer “yes”, but
            $\{ 1\}$ would answer “no”, or
        
            __do you contain 2?__
        
            to which $\{1\}$ and $\{1, 3\}$ would
            both answer “no”, but $\{1, 2, 3\}$ would
            answer “yes”.
        
            Notation-wise, the expression
            
            $$\Large x \in A$$
            
            means
        
            __$A$ contains $x$__
                
            or 
            
            __$A$ answers “yes” to the
            question “do you contain $x$?”__
            
            equivalently. [One can also say
            
            __$x$ in $A$__
                
            or 
                
            __$x$ is in $A$__
                
            or 
            
            __$x$ is an element of $A$__
        
            depending on one's mood and/or tastes.]
            As in all of mathematics, any such statement 
            evaluates to either “true” or “false”.
            For example,
            
            $$\Large 1 \in \{1, 2\}$$
            
            is true, because $1$ _is_ an element of the set 
            $\{1, 2\}$, whereas
            
            $$\Large 3 \in \{1, 2\}$$
        
            is false, because $3$ _is not_ 
            an element of the set $\{1, 2\}$.

            *Set Equality.*
            Two sets are deemed to be 
            equal if and only if they
            answer the same to
            all “do you contain ...?” questions.
            For example, while
            $$
            \Large\{2, 1\}
            $$
            might look superficially different from
            $$
            \Large\{1, 2\}
            $$
            these sets are actually one and the same, because they both
            answer “yes” to
        
            __do you contain 1?__
            __do you contain 2?__
                
            and answer “no” to all else. For that matter,
            $$
            \Large\{1, 1, 2\}
            $$
            might also look superficially different from
            $$
            \Large\{1, 2\}
            $$
            but since both sets answer “yes” to
        
            __do you contain 1?__
            __do you contain 2?__
                
            and answer “no” to all else,
            they are by definition the same.
        
            (These examples demonstrate that human notation 
            is redundant: there are several different ways of 
            writing down the same set. They also demonstrate
            that sets do not keep track of the
            
            __order__
            
            nor of the
            
            __multiplicity__
            
            of their elements. Such notions are simply not part
            of the “API” of a set.)
        
            Moreover, any empty set is equal to any other 
            empty set. Equality follows because both sets 
            answer all questions the same way: they both 
            answer “no” to everything. So there is
                
            __one__
            
            and only one empty set. Therefore, mathematicians speak of
            
            __the__
            
            empty set—the one and only!

            *Second notation for the empty set.* 
            While the empty set can be written
            $$
            \Large \{\}
            $$
            another available notation is
            $$
            \Large \phi
            $$
            which is the Greek letter phi, read “fee”. (Or “fie”?
            Hum.) (Or you can just say “the empty set”, and
            keep it safe.)
        
        |> Section
        
            *Sets within sets.*
            Sets can be nested much like Russian dolls.
            In fact, the result of doing this might even look like a little bit
            like a Russian doll (no?):
            $$
            \Large \{\{\{\{\}\}\}\}
            $$
            The above is “a set containing a set containing a set
            containing a set containing the empty set”. Eschewing complete
            adherence to the Russian doll aesthetic, we could also write
            $$
            \Large \{\{\{\phi\}\}\}
            $$
            for the same thing, given that $\phi = \{\}$.
        
            Mind you, concerning this example, that
            
            $$
            \Large \{\{\} \} \ne \{\}
            $$

                offset_x 1em
        
            because a box containing an empty box is not the same
            thing as an empty box! Specifically,
            $$
            \Large \{ \{\} \}
            $$
            answers “yes” to the question “do you contain 
            $\{\}$?”
            (a.k.a., “do you contain $\phi$?”) 
            whereas
            $$
            \Large \{\}
            $$
            answers “no” to the same question. (Indeed, while the empty set
            _contains_ nothing, it _is_ something.) Similarly,
            $$
            \Large \{\{\{\}\} \} \ne \{\{\}\}
            $$
            etc, etc: adding a new outer layer changes the whole set each time.
        
        |> Section
        
            *Set union and set intersection.*
            The so-called _union_
            of two sets $A$ and
            $B$ is written 
            $$\Large A \cup B$$
            and consists of the set of all things that are either in $A$ or in 
            $B.$
            For example,
            $$
            \Large \{1, 2\} \cup \{2, 5\} = \{1, 2, 5\}
            $$
            as $1$, $2$ and $5$ are the only elements to find
            themselves either in
            $\{1, 2\}$ or in $\{2, 5\}$.
            The so-called _intersection_ of two sets $A$ and
            $B$ is written 
            $$\Large A \cap B$$
            and consists of the set of all things that are both in $A$ and in 
            $B$.
            For example,
            $$
            \Large \{1, 2\} \cap \{2, 5\} = \{2\}
            $$
            as $2$ is the only element that is both in
            $\{1, 2\}$ and in $\{2, 5\}$.
        
            Note that
            $$
            \Large x \in (A \cup B)
            $$
            if and only if
            $$
            \Large x \in A
            $$
            _or_
            $$
            \Large x \in B
            $$
            because that's how we defined “union”. (Replace “or”
            by “and” to get a definition of intersection.)
            In fact, a logician would define the union of two sets by an
            abstruse expression of the type
            $$
            \Large x \in (A \cup B) \iff (x \in A) \vee (x \in B)
            $$
            read
            
            __an element $x$ is in the thing I call “$A \cup B$”
            if and only if $x$ is in $A$ or $x$ is in $B$__
                
            as “$\!\!\iff\!\!$” means “if and only if” and
            “$\vee$” means “or”. (You can figure out the 
            similar definition for the intersection of two sets
            if we tell you that
            
            $$\Large \wedge$$
        
            means “and”.)
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *Sets encountered in calculus.*
            In calculus, you will see sets such as _the real numbers_
            $$
            \Large\rr
            $$
            which is an infinite set containing all “ordinary”
            decimal numbers, or such as _the integers_
            $$
            \Large\zz
            $$
            which contains all “whole” numbers, including the
            negative ones. You might also encounter
            _the natural numbers_
            $$
            \Large\nn
            $$
            which contains only those integers that are greater than $0$ (i.e.,
            $\nn = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots \}$).
                
            Secondly—and this pretty much wraps it up for those sets 
            that are commonly seen in calculus—you will
            encounter _intervals_. For example,
            $$
            \Large [a, b]
            $$
            is a _closed interval_, consisting of all (real) numbers 
            greater than or equal to $a$, and less than or equal to $b$. Or
            $$
            \Large [a, b)
            $$
            is a _half-open_ interval, consisting of all real numbers
            greater than or equal to $a$, and less than $b$. Etc.
        
            Note that
            $$
            \Large (-\infty, \infty) = \rr
            $$
            since
            $$
            \Large (-\infty, \infty)
            $$
            (which is an _open_ interval, by the way) means
            
            __the set of real numbers with no bound below,
            and no bound above__
            
            which is all of $\rr$.
        
        |> Section
        
            *Sets not encountered in calculus.*
            If you take a more advanced course, you might encounter 
            the so-called _set of extended real numbers_,
            written
            $$
            \Large\overline{\rr}
            $$
            and which consists of all the numbers in $\rr$, plus the formal 
            symbols “$-\infty$”, “$\infty$” as well:
            $$
            \Large\overline{\rr} = \rr \cup \{-\infty, \infty\}
            $$
            (I.e., ...well, you get it!)
        
            You can view $\overline{\rr}$ as a kind “closed interval”
            version of $\rr$, that is, think of $\overline{\rr}$ as being
            the closed interval
            $$
            \Large [-\infty, \infty]
            $$
            with the two infinite endpoints _included_.
        
            Does all this have any “real meaning”? Good question! The answer
            is: _not until you give it one_.
        
            E.g. (to give you a brief flavor, before we move on forever from the topic),
            the value of something like
            $$
            \Large 0.5+ \infty
            $$
            must be _defined_. (It is defined to be $\infty$, in case you're curious.
            In fact, one has $a + \infty = \infty$ for any $a \ne -\infty$.) And some things
            remain explicitly _undefined_. For example, the expression
            $$
            \Large (-\infty) + \infty
            $$
            has an _undefined_ value—the same way, say, that division by
            $0$ is undefined in $\rr$. 
            (Well, anyway, end of lesson.)

        |> Section
        
            *Terminology.*
            The expression below is called a _power_; 
            the number at the bottom of the power is called
            the _base_ (of the power); the number at the top
            is called the _exponent_:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_base_exponent.svg
        
            The whole expression is read $\mathit{10}$ _to the power_ $\mathit{3}$, and the
            general process of taking a power is called _exponentiation_.
        
        
        |> Section
        
            *Integer powers of 10.*
            We define
            $$
            \Large 10^{\hspace{0.2ex}n}
            $$
            as follows, if $n$ is a nonnegative integer: start
            from $1$ and multiply by $10$ $n$ times. We also define
            $$
            \Large 10^{-n}
            $$
            as follows, if $n$ is a positive integer: start from $1$ and divide
            by $10$ $n$ times. 
        
            For example,
            $$
            \Large 10^4 = 1 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10000
            $$
            $$
            \Large 10^3 = 1 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 1000
            $$
            $$
            \Large 10^2 = 1 \times 10 \times 10 = 100
            $$
            $$
            \Large 10^1 = 1 \times 10 = 10
            $$
        
            $$
            \Large 10^0 = 1 = 1
            $$

            (where, in the last line, $1$ is multiplied by $10$ _zero times_,
            as per the exponent, which is zero) by the first definition, while
            $$
            \Large 10^{-1} = 1\,/\,10 = 0.1
            $$
            $$
            \Large 10^{-2} = (1\,/\, 10)\,/\,10 = 0.01
            $$
            $$
            \Large 10^{-3} = ((1\,/\, 10)\,/\,10)\,/\,10 = 0.001
            $$
            $$
            \Large 10^{-4} = (((1\,/\, 10)\,/\,10)\,/\, 10)\,/\, 10 = 0.0001
            $$
            by the second definition.
                    
            As $n$ successive divisions
            by $10$ is the same as one division by $10^n$, one also has
            $$
            \Large 10^{-n} = {1 \over 10^{\hspace{0.2ex}n}}\tag{A}
            $$
            for every positive integer $n$, which gives an alternate means of computing $10^{-n}$.
            Moreover, (A) actually holds for
            
            __every__
            
            integer $n$, which is mildly important. In more
            detail, (A) holds for $n = 0$ by inspection, and (A) 
            is equivalent to the identity
        
            |> ImageLeft
                src images/svg_zero_verification_cloud.svg
        
            $$
            \Large 10^{-n}10^n = 1 \tag{AA}
            $$
        
            which holds for $n$ if and only if it holds for
            $-n$. (By which we mean: replacing “$n$” by “$-n$”
            in (AA) lands you right back on (AA), due to the fact
            that $-{(-n)} = n$.) (So, namely, if (AA) holds for all
            positive values of $\hspace{0.05em}n$, then it holds
            for all negative values of $n$, as well.)

            Numbers $a$ and $b$ such that
            $$
            \Large ab = 1
            $$
            are _reciprocal_.
            If $a$ and $b$ are reciprocal, then 
            these equations are satisfied...
            $$
            \Large ab = 1 \qquad a = {1 \over b} \qquad b = {1 \over a}
            $$
            ...and any one of these equations implies the other two.
            Thus, either of (A) and (AA) expresses the
        
            __reciprocality__
            
            of $10^n$ and $10^{-n}$.

            *Other bases.*
            Integer powers of other nonzero bases are defined similarly, e.g.,
            $$
            \Large 2^{-2}
            $$
            is defined as $1$ divided by $2$ twice, etc.
        
            However, a small quirk occurs for base $0$: as one cannot
            divide by $0$, negative powers of $0$ remain undefined. E.g.,
            $$
            \Large 0^{-2}
            $$
            would be “$1$ divided by $0$ twice”, but this
            is undefined. 
            Hence $0^{-1}$, $0^{-2}$, etc, remain undefined.
        
            Also (in case you're wondering) $0^0 = 1$.
            You can see this by writing down the first few powers of $0$ in descending order:
            $$
            \Large 0^3 = 1 \times 0 \times 0 \times 0 = 0
            $$
            $$
            \Large 0^2 = 1 \times 0 \times 0 = 0
            $$
            $$
            \Large 0^1 = 1 \times 0 = 0
            $$
            $$
            \Large 0^0 = 1 = 1
            $$
            In other words, every positive power of $0$ is zero, 
            but when it comes to $0^0$,
            the ‘$0\hspace{0.12ex}$’ in the
            exponent “wins out” over the ‘$0\hspace{0.12ex}$’ in the base, 
            making the result $1$.
        
            Note that mathematicians sometimes refer 
            to a power with an exponent of $0$ as an
        
            __empty product__
        
            and they will repeatedly admonish that
        
            __an empty product is $\mathit{1}$__
            
            in the sense that “all products start at 
            $1$”, and that if you start at $1$ and don't
            multiply anything in, you stay at $1$.

            *Additivity of exponents.*
            If you think about it,
            $$
            \Large 10^{13} \times 10^{14} = 10^{\hspace{0.1ex}27}
            $$
            because $13$ multiplications by $10$ followed
            by $14$ multiplications by $10$ makes $13 + 14 = 27$
            multiplications by $10$.
        
            More generally,
            $$
            \Large 10^{\hspace{0.1ex}n} \times 10^{\hspace{0.1ex}m} = 10^{\hspace{0.1ex}n + m}
            $$
            for all $n$ and $m$ (and other bases than $10$),
            which is known as
        
            __additivity of exponents__
            
            and which is sometimes paraphrased by saying
            that
        
            __the product of the powers is the power of the sum__
            
            where _the product of the powers_ refers to
            “$10^n \times 10^m$” and _the power of the sum_
            refers to “$10^{n+m}$”. (Or for some other base.)

            *The third law of exponents.*
            Also, if you think about it,
            $$
            \Large (10^{13})^{14} = 10^{13\cdot 14}
            $$
            because multiplying $14$ times by $10^{13}$ is like
            multiplying $13\cdot 14$ times by $10$. More
            generally,
            $$
            \Large (10^n)^m = 10^{nm}
            $$
            for all $n$ and $m$. This is known as “the third law 
            of exponents”. 
        
            On this subject, note that if one writes
            $$
            \Large a^{b^{c}}
            $$
            [“$a$ to the power $b$ to the power $c$”]
            there is a seeming ambiguity: does it mean
            $$
            \Large a^{\left(b^{c}\right)}
            $$
            [“$a$ to the power [$b$ to the power $c$]”]
            or does it mean
            $$
            \Large (a^{b})^{c}
            $$
            [“[$a$ to the power $b$] to the power $c$”]...?
            Well, because the second way can be written
            $$
            \Large a^{bc}
            $$
            by the third law of exponents, the second way already has  
            “its own” notation, and therefore the convention is that... 
            $$
            \Large a^{b^c}
            $$
            ...absolutely always means... 
            $$
            \Large a^{\left(b^c\right)}
            $$
            ...!

            *Famous powers of 10.*
            Many human languages have special names for
            various integer powers of $10$, due to the fact
            that many of our ancestors chose to count in base
            $10$.
        
            In English, e.g., these are some of the “famous”
            powers of $10$:

            One can note that
            __one million is a thousand thousand__
            because
            $$
            \Large 1000 \times 1000 = 1000\hspace{0.3ex}000
            $$
            by counting zeroes, or, equivalently, because
            $$
            \Large 10^3 \times 10^3 = 10^6
            $$
            by additivity of exponents. Similarly, note that
            
            __one billion is a thousand million__

            as can be seen, for example, by replacing “billion”
            with “thousand million” in the previous sentence and
            then further replacing “thousand thousand” with “million”
            in _that_ sentence.

            In passing, note how the standard decimal expansion
            for $10^{-1}$ contains exactly one ${0}$:
        
            |> Image
                src images/svg_one_blue_one_image_equation.svg
            
            Likewise, the standard decimal expansion for $10^{-2}$
            contains exactly two $0$'s...
            
            |> Image
                src images/svg_two_blue_one_image_equation.svg
            
            ...and so on, which is a possible trick to check 
            one's work and avoid mistakes.
        
            However, there also exist negative exponent
            
            __prefixes__
            
            that people use to qualify other measures. For
            example, a
            
            __millimeter__
            
            is $10^{-3}$ meters, i.e., one thousandth of
            a meter, because “milli” happens to be the prefix
            for $10^{-3}$. Here is a list of the most common

            *Logarithms base 10.*
            Every positive number can be uniquely 
            written as “ten to the power something”.
            This “something” will heretofore be called
            the _logarithm base $\mathit{10}$_ of that 
            (positive) number.
        
            For example,
            $$
            \Large 100
            $$
            can be uniquely written as “ten to the power
            something”. To wit, $100$ is, of course,
            
            __ten to the power $\mathit{2}$__
        
            and this means that
            $$
            \Large 2
            $$
            is the logarithm base $10$ of $100$.
        
            |> Example
        
                It so happens that
                $$
                \Large 99 = 10^{1.99563519...}
                $$
                under an extended definition of exponentiation that allows us to 
                compute $10^x$ for every $x \in \rr$. 
                So 
                $$
                \Large 1.99563519...
                $$
                is the logarithm base $10$ of $99$.
        
            |> Example
        
                It so happens that
                $$
                \Large 98 = 10^{1.99122607...}
                $$
                under the same extended definition, so 
                $$
                \Large 1.99122607...
                $$
                is the logarithm base $10$ of $98$.
        
            |> Example
        
                Since
                $$
                \Large 0.1 = 10^{-1}
                $$
                the logarithm base $10$ of $0.1$ is $-1$.
        
            |> Example
        
                Since
                $$

                Compute $2^{-2}$, $2^{-3}$ and $2^{-4}$ by hand.
        
                |> Solution
        
                    Since $2^{-1} = 1/2 = 0.5$, one has
                    $$
                    \Large 2^{-2} = {2^{-1}\over 2} = {0.5 \over 2} = 0.25
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large 2^{-3} = {2^{-2}\over 2} = {0.25 \over 2} = 0.125
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large 2^{-4} = {2^{-3}\over 2} = {0.125 \over 2} = 0.0625
                    $$
                    respectively.            
        
                    _Notes._ 
                    For the last computation, $0.125$ can be viewed 
                    as twelve hundredths plus $5$ thousandths:
        
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_0.125_twelve_5.svg
                    
                    Half of twelve hundredths is six hundredths, and 
                    half of $5$ thousandths is $2.5$ thousandths:
                    
                    |> Image
                        src images/svg_06_and_0025.svg
                    
                    ...so $0.125/2$ is $0.06 + 0.0025 = 0.0625$.
        
            |> Exercise
        
                Compute $100/16$ by hand.
        
                |> Solution
        
                    We have
                    $$
                    \Large {1 \over 16} = {1 \over 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2} = 2^{-4} = 0.0625
                    $$
                    so
                    $$
                    \Large {100 \over 16} = 100 \cdot {1 \over 16} = 100\cdot 0.0625 = 6.25
                    $$
                    and that's all there is to it! (Or you could repeatedly divide $100$ by $2$,
                    until you reach $6.25$, after the fourth division.)
        
            |> Exercise
        
                If “万” is Chinese for _ten thousand_, what is “万万” in English?
                What about “万万万”?
        
                |> Solution
        
                    “万万” is “ten thousand ten thousand”, or
                    $$
                    \Large 10^4 \times 10^4 = 10^8
                    $$
                    or _one hundred million_ since $10^8 = 10^2 \times 10^6$ is a hundred times a 
                    million. Similarly, “万万万” is 
                    $$
                    \Large 10^4 \times 10^4 \times 10^4 = 10^{12}
                    $$
                    which is just one trillion.

                    _Notes._
                    Rearranging

                    to
                    
                    __ten ten thousand thousand__
                    
                    directly leads us to “hundred million” 
                    without having to use exponents, since ten
                    times ten is a hundred and since a thousand 
                    times a thousand is a million.
                
                    (Similarly,
                    
                    __ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand__

                    __ten ten ten thousand thousand thousand__
                    
                    after rearrangement, which can be seen to
                    equal one trillion because “ten ten ten” is
                    a thousand.)

                How many millimeters in a kilometer? 
                How many kilometers in a millimeter?
        
                |> Solution
        
                    There are $10^3$ millimeters in a meter 
                    (_milli_ = thousandth) and $10^3$ meters
                    in a kilometer, so there are 
                    $10^3 \times 10^3 = 10^6$ 
                    millimeters in a kilometer.
        
                    From there, it automatically follows that
                    there are $1/10^6 = 10^{-6}$ kilometers in
                    a millimeter.
        
                    (Or you can run the reverse reasoning: 
                    There are $10^{-3}$ kilometers in a meter, 
                    and $10^{-3}$ meters in a millimeter, 
                    so $10^{-3} \times 10^{-3} = 10^{-6}$ 
                    kilometers in a millimeter.)
        
            |> Exercise
        
                How many kilometers is $10^{24}$ millimeters?
        
                |> Solution
        
                    We have
                    $$
                    \Large 1\textrm{mm} = 10^{-6}\textrm{km}
                    $$
                    by the previous problem, so 
                    $$
                    \Large 10^{24} \textrm{mm} = 10^{24}\cdot 10^{-6}\textrm{km} = 10^{18}\textrm{km}
                    $$
                    by direct substitution. (You can do that with
                    units.) The answer is therefore: $10^{18}$.
            
            |> Exercise
        
                If the US yearly budget is $4$ trillion
                dollars, what percentage of the budget is
                one hundred billion \$?
        
                |> Solution
        
                    One hundred billion is $10\%$ of one trillion [cf.: 
                    $10^2 \times 10^9 = {1 \over 10}\times 10^{12}$]
                    and one trillion is a quarter of $4$ 
                    trillion, so the answer is ${1\over 4}\cdot 10\% = 2.5\%$.

                    There is no such thing as “the U.S. budget”. A
                    monetarily sovereign nation _spends_ its currency
                    into existence. (And taxes it out of existence.)

                |> Solution
        
                    Since 
                    $$
                    %\Large 10^{12}\times 10^{9}\times 10^{6}\times 10^3 = 10^{12+9+6+3} = 10^{30}
                    \Large 10^{12}\times 10^{9}\times 10^{6}\times 10^3 = 10^{12+9+6+3}
                    $$
                    the answer is $12+9+6+3$, i.e., $30$.

                |> Solution
        
                    We have
                    $$
                    \Large {10^6 \cdot 10^{-12} \cdot 10^{10} \over 10^{-4}\cdot 10^{-4}} = {10^{6-12+10} \over 10^{-4 -4}} = {10^4 \over 10^{-8}}
                    $$
                    and
                    $$
                    \Large {10^4 \over 10^{-8}} = 10^4 \cdot {1 \over 10^{-8}} = 10^4\cdot 10^{-(-8)}
                    $$
                    and
                    $$
                    \Large 10^4\cdot 10^{-(-8)} = 10^4\cdot 10^8 = 10^{4 + 8} = 10^{12}
                    $$
                    so the answer is $10^{12}$.

                How many _millibits_ in a _gigabyte_?
        
                |> Solution
        
                    Presumably, there are $1000$ “millibits”
                    (whatever those are, we can go along with
                    the joke here) in one bit. Since there are
                    eight bits in a byte, and a million bytes 
                    in a gigabyte, this means that there would
                    be
                    $$
                    \Large 1000 \times 8 \times 10^6 = 8 \times 10^9
                    $$
                    or $8$ billion “millibits” per gigabyte.
                    (But to reiterate, there is no such thing 
                    as a “millibit”; a bit is a _discrete_—i.e., 
                    indivisible—unit of computer memory.)

                    stated earlier in the chapter as (A), while the third equality uses
                    additivity of exponents, also stated earlier. (So: We are only using “known”
                    facts, alongside some ordinary arithmetic.)

                |> Solution
        
                    Firstly we can rewrite $v$, $F$, $\mu$, $\rho$
                    in the canonical form $M^xL^yT^z$
                    for integers $x$, $y$, $z$ (as in the previous
                    exercise):
                    $$
                    \Large v = LT^{-1} \vphantom{\rho = ML^{-3}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large F = MLT^{-2} \vphantom{\rho = ML^{-3}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large \mu = MT^{-1}L^{-1} \vphantom{\rho = ML^{-3}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large \rho = ML^{-3}
                    $$
                    (Ok.) Nextly, we compute $v^a$, $F^b$, $\mu^c$
                    by applying the fourth law of exponents (note e.g.
                    that $(T^{-1})^a = T^{(-1)a} = T^{-a}$, etc):
                    $$
                    \Large v^a = L^aT^{-a} \vphantom{\rho = ML^{-3}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large F^b = M^{b}L^bT^{-2b} \vphantom{\rho = ML^{-3}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large \mu^c = M^cT^{-c}L^{-c} \vphantom{\rho = ML^{-3}}
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large \rho = ML^{-3}
                    $$
                    (In the last line we just restated $\rho$.)
                    Then $v^aF^b\mu^c\rho$ becomes
                    $$
                    \Large M^{b+c+1}L^{a+b-c-3}T^{-a-2b-c}
                    $$
                    by multiplying everything together and using
                    additivity of exponents. (E.g., $M^bM^cM = M^{b+c+1}$,
                    and so on.) This expression equals 
                    $$
                    \Large 1
                    $$ 
                    independently of the values of $M$, $L$, $T$
                    if and only if...
                    
                    __the three exponents are zero__
                    
                    ...(!!!) which means that we need to find values
                    $a$, $b$ and $c$ such that these three equations...
                    $$
                    \Large b + c + 1 = 0
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large a + b - c - 3 = 0
                    $$
                    $$
                    \Large -a -2b - c = 0
                    $$

                    ...are satisfied! Adding the second and 
                    third equation together, we find 
                    $$
                    \Large -b -2c -3 = 0
                    $$
                    and adding this last equation to the first
                    equation above, we find 
                    $$
                    \Large -c -2 = 0
                    $$
                    which implies that $-c = 2$, i.e., that $c = -2$. 
                    Plugging $c = -2$ into the first of our three
                    equations, we find
                    $$
                    \Large b + (-2) + 1 = 0
                    $$
                    or
                    $$
                    \Large b - 1 = 0
                    $$
                    which implies that $b = 1$. Lastly, plugging
                    $b = 1$, $c = -2$ in our second equation above
                    gives us 
                    $$
                    \Large a + 1 - (-2) - 3 = 0
                    $$
                    which implies that $a = 0$ since $1-(-2)-3 = 0$.
                    (One can finally check that 
                    setting $a=0$, $b = 1$, $c=-2$ satisfies that
                    third equation, $-a-2b-c=0$, which it does.)
        
                    In summary, the solution is $a = 0$, $b = 1$,
                    $c = -2$; we have discovered that 
                    $$
                    \Large v^0 F^1 \mu^{-2} \rho = 1
                    $$
                    under the given definitions of $v$, $F$, $\mu$
                    and $\rho$, or which is to say, we have discovered
                    that
                    $$
                    \Large F\mu^{-2}\rho = 1
                    $$
                    (since $v^0 = 1$, $F^1 = F$).
