    __function__

    is a “rule” for transforming inputs (usually
    numbers) into outputs (usually numbers as well). 
    One can think of a function as a box with an 
    “input tube” and an “output tube”:

    An input goes in via the input tube, is
    processed according to the function's rule,
    and the result comes out the other side.
    (Metaphorically speaking.)

    In the above picture, the name of the function
    is “ $f$.
    
    Notation-wise, one writes

    $$
    {f(x)}
    $$

    (which is read “$f$ of $x$”, and that's 
    important) for the result of passing an input $x$ 
    to a function $f$. For example, if the rule 
    according to which $f$ processes inputs is

    __the output is the square of the input__

    then

    $$
    {f(2) = 4}
    $$

    [“$f$ of $2$ equals $4$”] because $2^2 = 4$, and

    $$
    {f(3) = 9}
    $$

    [“$f$ of $3$ equals $9$”] because $3^2 = 9$, and
    $$
    { f(0.1) = 0.01}
    $$

    [...] because $0.1^2 = 0.01$, and so on. Also,

    $$
    {f(x) = x^2}
    $$

    [“$f$ of $x$ equals $x^2$”] more generally, which 
    is actually the

    __definition__
    
    of $f$!! (Stated algebraically.)
