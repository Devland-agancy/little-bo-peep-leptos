        function
    </p><p class="acq">
        is a “rule” for transforming inputs (usually numbers)
        into outputs (usually numbers as well). One can think of a function
        as a box with an “input tube” and an “output tube”:
    </p>
    <center>
        <img src="ch3figs/svg_f_box.svg" width="380" style="padding-right:3px; padding-top:13px; padding-bottom:20px"/>
    </center>
    <p class="nb">
        An input that comes in via the input tube is processed
        by the box according the function's rule, and the
        result comes out the other side. 
        (Metaphorically speaking.)
    </p><p>
        In the above picture, the name of the function is 
        <span class="nowrap">“$\hspace{0.1ex}f\hspace{0.2ex}$”</span>.
    </p><p>
        Notation-wise, one writes
        $$
        {f(x)}
        $$
        (which is read “$f$ of $x$”, and that's important) 
        for the result of passing an input $x$ to a function $f$.
        For example, if the rule according to which $f$ processes inputs is
    </p><p class="cq">
        the output is the square of the input
    </p><p class="acq">
        then
        $$
        {f(2) = 4}
        $$
        [“$f$ of $2$ equals $4$”] because 
        $2^2 = 4$, and
        $$
        {f(3) = 9}
        $$
        [“$f$ of $3$ equals $9$”] because 
        $3^2 = 9$, and
        $$
        { f(0.1) = 0.01}
        $$
        [...] because 
        $0.1^2 = 0.01$,
        and so on. Also,
        $$
        {f(x) = x^2}
        $$
        [“$f$ of $x$ equals $x^2$”] more generally, which is actually the

        <b>Lambda functions.</b> A
    </p><p class="cq">
        lambda function
    </p><p class="acq">
        is not a type of function, but a type of notation that enables one to 
        define a function without giving it a name, such as “$f$”.
    </p>
    <p>
        In fact there are two different mainstream notations,
        in this instance.
        One notation writes
        $$
        \lambda{x}.x^2
        $$
        to mean 
        “the function that maps $x$ to $x^2$” 
        (and by the way,
        $$
        \lambda{z}.z^2
        $$
        is <i>the same</i> function, because 
        it specifies the same in-out mapping—a thing goes to its square—also by the way, the symbol
        $$
        {\Huge \lambda}
        $$
        is the Greek letter “lambda”, giving its name to the topic)
        while the other notation writes 
        $$
        x \rightarrow x^2
        $$
        to mean the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that
        $$
        (x \ra x^2)(0.1)
        $$
        means 
        “the function that maps each number to its square, of $0.1$”.
        So...
        $$
        (x \ra x^2)(0.1) = 0.01
        $$
        ...is the same as an equation of the form “$f(\dots) = \dots$”.
    </p>
    <p>
        For more practice:
        $$
        (\lambda x.x^3)(10) = 1000
        $$
        $$
        (\lambda u.u^5)(10) = 100000
        $$
        $$
        (v \ra v^2)(10) = 100
        $$
        $$
        (z \ra z^3)(10) + (t \ra t^2)(5) = 1025.
        $$
        (Etc.) (Indeed, to emphasize again, the variable denoting the 
        input does not matter: it is just a placeholder, and you obtain 
        the same output, and the same <i>function</i>, no matter what symbol 
        you choose.*) (*As long as you don't collide with other 
        existing variable names.)
    </p>

    <p class="nb">
        <b>Definition by cases.</b>
        Sometimes a function is defined by an expression of the form
        $$
        {
            x \ra \begin{cases}
            \ldots &amp; \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \ldots &amp; \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \vdots &amp; \vdots\\
            \ldots &amp; \te{$\ldots$}
            \end{cases}
        }
        $$
        where the right-hand side is a list of mutually exclusive
        cases to consider according to the value of $x$. Equivalently,
        $$
        {
            g(x) = \begin{cases}
            \ldots &amp; \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \ldots &amp; \te{if $\ldots$}\\
            \vdots &amp; \vdots\\
            \ldots &amp; \te{$\ldots$}
            \end{cases}
        }
        $$
        in the case where the function has a name, such as “$g$”.
    </p>

    <p class="nb">
        <b>Example 1.</b>
        If VX-11/78A (don't mind the weird name, chosen at random) is the function defined by
        $$
        {
            \te{VX-11/78A}(x) = \begin{cases} 
            3.5 &amp; \te{if $x = 0$},\\
            2.5\up{1.1} &amp; \te{if $x = 1$},\\
            \te{undefined}\up{1.1} &amp; \te{if $x \ne 0, 1$}
            \end{cases}
        }
        $$
        then
        $$
        {\te{VX-11/78A}(0) = 3.5,}
        $$
        and
        $$
        {\te{VX-11/78A}(1) = 2.5,}
        $$
        aaand... and these are the only two values of $x$ for which
        VX-11/78A$(x)$ is defined, as specified.
    </p>

    <p class="nb">
        <b>On arbitrariness.</b>
        While a function such as VX-11/78A might seem completely
        arbitrary, one lesson from the former example is that functions <i>can</i> be completely arbitrary!
    </p><p>
        In fact, 
        there are only two “ground rules” to respect
        in order for something to qualify as a function: 
        <b>(i)</b> to output
    </p><p class="cq">
        one
    </p><p class="acq">
        output per (accepted) input, and 
        <b>(ii)</b>
        to return the
    </p><p class="cq">
        same
    </p>
    <p class="acq">
        output each time on the same input. 
        (Sometimes, functions are said to be
    </p><p class="cq">
        deterministic
    </p><p class="acq">
        because of <b>(ii)</b>.)
    </p>

    <p class="nb">
        <b>Graphs.</b> 
        The
    </p><p class="cq">
        graph
    </p><p class="acq">
        of a function is a visualization device. A point on the graph corresponds to an
        input for which the function is defined. The $x$-coordinate of the point
        is the value of the input, while the $y$-coordinate is the value of the
        corresponding output.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, here is a graph of VX-11/78A:

        As already seen, functions can have
        <i>discontinuities</i>: a place where
        the function experiences a sudden “jump” in value.
    </p>

    <p>
        For a famous example of a
        “naturally” occurring discontinuity 
        (that we feel compelled to mention, for some reason) 
        we need look no further
        than the function
        $$
        %\qquad\! 0^x
        {\Large x \ra 0^x}
        $$
        as it so happens that
        $$
        {0^x = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; \te{if } x > 0\\
        1 &amp; \te{if } x = 0\\
        \te{undefined} &amp; \te{if }x &lt; 0 \end{cases}}
        $$
    </p><p class="noi">
        which implies a discontinuity in the graph of $y = 0^x$ at $x = 0$, 
        as pictured here:

        is a <i>value</i> (not a function) and the way logicians think of it,

        <!-- The <i>degree</i> of the polynomial is the highest power of $x$ that appears with a nonzero coefficient. -->
        The <i>degree</i> of the polynomial is $k$, if $a_k \ne 0$. (Otherwise, work your way 
        down until you find a nonzero coefficient—if there are none, because the polynomial is 
        just the constant $0$, then the degree is <i>minus infinity</i>.) (We're not kidding.)
