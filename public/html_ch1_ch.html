		<b>Square Roots.</b>
		You might remember that “minus times minus is plus”
		and that “plus times plus is plus”.
		(Why? The enemy of my enemy is my friend.)
		So any nonzero number multiplied by itself is positive.
		For example,
		$$
		(-2) \times (-2) = 4
		$$
		and
		$$
		2 \times 2 = 4
		$$
		are both positive. But $\sqrt{4}$ is, by definition,
		the unique <i>nonnegative</i> solution to $x^2 = 4$.
		Hence, and whether you like it or not,
	</p>
	<div style="position:relative;">
		<div class="abs_middle_anchor">
			<div style="position:absolute;left:18em;top:-1.65em;">
				<img src="ch1figs/svg_cloud_minus_two_squared.svg" style="position:absolute;width:600px;left:-9.06em;top:-6.02em;"/>
				$$
				(-2)^2 = 4,\,\, \sqrt{4} = 2
				$$
			</div>
		</div>
		$$
		\sqrt{(-2)^2} = 2
		$$
	</div>
	<p class="noi">
		and, in particular, it is <i>not</i> true that
		$$
		\sqrt{x^{2}} \rt{0.1} = \rt{0.1} x
		$$
		for every real number $x$. Instead we have
		$$
		\sqrt{x^{2}} \rt{0.1} = \rt{0.1} |x|
		$$
		for every real number $x$, where $|x|$ 
		denotes the absolute value of $x$.
	</p>

	<p class="cheatingten">
		(Nb: If ever you want to indicate both solutions of the
		equation $x^2 = 4$ you can always use the notation 
		“$\pm \sqrt{4}$”. 
		This is what happens, for example, in the 
		maybe-well-known formula
		$$
		x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}
		$$
	</p><p class="noi">
		for the solutions to the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$.)
	</p>

	<p>
		Now we can ponder, say,
		$$
		\sqrt{0.5}
		$$
		whose value is&mdash;by definition&mdash;the unique nonnegative solution
		to
		$$
		x^2 = 0.5.
		$$
		As beginners, there's nothing wrong with trying to solve this equation by
		trial and error. With $x = \frac{1}{4}$, for example, we find
		$$
		x^2 = \frac{1}{4}\times\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{16}
		$$
		so $x = \frac{1}{4}$ is not a solution of the equation, being 
		apparently too small. Increasing $x$ to $x = \frac{1}{2}$, say, we find
		$$
		x^2 = \frac{1}{2}\times\frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
		$$
		which is better, since $1/4$ is closer to $1/2$, but still too
		small. Increasing $x$ by $1/4$ again, say, to $x = \frac{3}{4}$, we find
		$$
		x^2 = \frac{3}{4}\times\frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{16}
		$$
		which&mdash;surprise!&mdash;is actually pretty close to $1/2$, as 
		$1/2 = 8/16$. And since $9/16 > 0.5$, $\sqrt{0.5}$ must be a little
		<i>less</i> than $\frac{3}{4} = 0.75$.
	</p>

	<p>
		In last resort, and in reasonably good agreement with our 
		observations, a calculator reveals that
		$$
		\sqrt{0.5} = 0.7071067...
		$$
		where the decimals trail off with no pattern. (This number is irrational.) Even so, the fact that $\sqrt{0.5}$ is <i>greater</i> than $0.5$
		is often perceived as counterintuitive.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can think of it this way: multiplying a value by $0.7071$, or approximately $\sqrt{0.5}$, is like taking $70.71\%$ 
		of that value&mdash;for example, say,
		$$
		605 \cdot 0.7071 = 427.7955
		$$
		is $70.71\%$ of $605$, and so on&mdash;so if we multiply
		<i>twice</i> by $0.7071$ we obtain “$70.71\%$ of $70.71\%$” 
		and it just so happens that <span style="white-space:nowrap">“$70.71\%$</span> of $70.71\%$” is 
		close to $50\%$.
	</p>

	<p>
		The point is: if
		“$X\%$ of $X\%$” equals $50\%$, 
		then, of course, $\rt{0.03}X > 50$&mdash;that much seems logical&mdash;and, with
		a little thought, the same phenomenon explains why
		$\sqrt{0.5} > 0.5$.
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Fractions and Division.</b> 
		An elementary fraction, or division, such as
		$$
		{50 \over 2}
		$$
		can be thought of in a few different ways:
	</p>

	<div class="column">
		<ol style="margin-left:50px; margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:0px;">

		<li>Fifty halves (i.e., $50 \times \frac{1}{2}$).</li>

		<li>The size obtained when something of size fifty is
			divided into two equal parts (answer: $25$).</li>

		<li>The number of times that $2$ goes into $50$
			(answer: $25$, because it takes twenty-five $2$'s to make up $50$).</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

	<p class="nb">
		But $50/2$ is a ratio of integers, which makes things particularly nice! 
		For a ratio of decimals, such as, say,
		$$
		{1 \over 0.01}
		$$
		our possible points of view are going to be more restricted.
		Thankfully, 
		however, we can still characterize this fraction
		as the answer to the question “how many times does $0.01$
		go into $1$?” as in the third option above. And, indeed,
		$$
		{1 \over 0.01} \,=\,100
		$$
		because $0.01$ goes $100$ times into $1$. For that matter,
		$$
		{ 1 \over 0.001} = 1000,\qquad{1 \over 0.0001} = 10000,\quad\,\,\,\,\textrm{(etc)}
		$$
		by the same reasoning, which explains why dividing 
		by smaller and smaller numbers produces larger and larger
		results (and, by extension, why dividing by $0$ is undefined).
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Note.</b> In general, the ratio of two decimal numbers can be
		turned into a ratio of integers by multiplying the ratio top
		and bottom by a suitable power of $10$. E.g.:
		$$
		{1.42 \over 0.8} = {100 \cdot 1.42 \over 100 \cdot 0.8} = {142 \over 80} = {71 \over 40}.
		$$
		This example was chosen randomly, and, if you allow, we would
		like to see how large $71/40$ really is (one second!):
		$$
		\begin{align}
		{71 \over 40} \,&=\, {40 + 30 + 1 \over 40} \,=\, {40 \over 40} + {30 \over 40} + {1 \over 40}\\
		\,&=\, 1 + {3 \over 4} + {1 \over 4}\!\cdot \!{1 \over 10}\up{1.5}\\
		\,&=\, 1 + 0.75 + 0.025 = 1.775\up{1.5}
		\end{align}
		$$
		...so we find, among others, that $71$ is exactly $77.5\%$ greater
		than $40$. (Interesting, no?)
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Distributivity.</b>
		As you might already know, a number that multiplies a sum can be 
		brought “inside” the sum. For example,
		$$
		5(10 + 2) \,=\, 5\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 5\!\cdot\!2
		$$
		(five times twelve equals fifty plus ten), or
		$$
		a(b + c) = ab + ac
		$$
		more generally. This property is known as the <i>distributivity
		of multiplication over addition</i>, or <i>distributivity</i> for 
		short.
	</p>

	<p>
		(We might finally clarify that &lsquo;$\cdot$&rsquo; means “times”, 
		i.e., the same as &lsquo;$\times$&rsquo;. Moreover, when we write
		$$
		5\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 5\!\cdot\!2
		$$
		we really mean
		$$
		(5\!\cdot\!10) + (5\!\cdot\!2)
		$$
		as opposed to something else, such as
		$$
		((5\!\cdot\!10) + 5)\!\cdot\! 2,
		$$
	</p><p class="noi">
		because multiplication takes precedence over addition, by
		default.)
	</p>

	<p>
		A little more generally, one has such identities as
	</p>
	<div style="position:relative;">
		<div class="abs_middle_anchor">
			<img src="ch1figs/svg_abCD_D.svg" style="position:absolute;width:400px;right:12.5em;top:-7.9em;"/>
		</div>
		$$
		(a + b)(C + D) \,=\, aC + bC + aD + bD
		$$
	</div>
	<p class="noi">
		that come from multiplying every term of the first parenthesis
		with every term of the second parenthesis. Indeed,
		$$
		(a + b)(C + D) = (a + b)C + (a + b)D
		$$
		by one application of distributivity, while
		$$
		(a + b)C = aC + bC
		$$
		$$
		(a + b)D = aD + bD
		$$
		by distributivity again.
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Example 1.</b> One has
		$$
		\begin{align}
		(10 + 2)(10 + 4) \,&=\, 10\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 10\!\cdot\!4 \,+\, 2\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 2\!\cdot\!4\\
							\,&=\, 100 \,+\, 40 \,+\, 20 \,+\, 8\\
							\,&=\, 168
		\end{align}
		$$
		so $12 \times 14 = 168$.
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Example 2.</b> One has
		$$
		\begin{align}
		(10 + 3)(10 + 3) \,&=\, 10\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 10\!\cdot\!3 \,+\, 3\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 3\!\cdot\!3\\
							\,&=\, 100 \,+\, 30 \,+\, 30 \,+\, 9\\
							\,&=\, 169
		\end{align}
		$$
		so $13 \times 13 = 169$.
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		(The fact that $13 \times 13$ is exactly one 
		greater than $12 \times 14$ is a bit curious indeed.)
	</p>

	<p>
		If we start from the afore-mentioned identity
		$$
		(a + b)(C + D) \,=\, aC + bC + aD + bD
		$$
		and set $C = a$, $D = b$, we find
		$$
		(a + b)(a + b) \,=\, aa + ba + ab + bb
		$$
		or, equivalently,
		$$
		(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2
		$$
	</p><p class="noi">
		since $(a + b)(a + b) = (a + b)^2$, $aa = a^2$ and $bb = b^2$. (This
		is the <i>binomial expansion of degree two</i>, but such terminology
		is not very important at this stage.)
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Example 3.</b> 
		By the last formula (or “binomial expansion of degree two”),
		$$
		\begin{align}
		\up{1} (10 + 3)^2 \,&=\, 10\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 2\!\cdot\!3\!\cdot\!10 \,+\, 3\!\cdot\!3 \\
		\up{1} \,&=\, 100 + 60 + 9 \\
		\up{1} \,&=\, 169
		\end{align}
		$$
		which agrees with Example 2.
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		On the other hand, setting $C = a$, $D = -b$ in
		$$
		\,\,\,(a + b)(C + D) = aC + aD + bC + bD
		$$
		gives
		$$
		\,\,\,(a + b)(a + (-b)) = aa + a(-b) + ba + b(-b)
		$$
		or, less pedantically,
		$$
		\,\,\,(a + b)(a - b) = aa - ab + ba - bb
		$$
		or
		$$
		\,\,\,(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2
		$$
		since $- ab + ba = 0$, $aa = a^2$, $bb = b^2$. Note that
		$$
		\,\,\,a^2 - b^2
		$$
		is
	</p><p class="cq">
		a difference of squares
	</p><p class="acq">
		whence <i>a difference of squares can always be factored</i>. 
		(Factored as $(a + b)(a - b)$, that is.)
		(PS: “Factored” means “written as a product”.)
		<!-- (PS: We say that
		something has been “factored” when it is written

	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Example 4.</b> Since
		$$
							19 = 100 - 81 = 10^2 - 9^2
		$$
		is a difference of squares, $19$ can be factored. (On the other
		hand $19$ is a prime number, but nevermind.)
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Example 5</b>. The algebraic expression
		$$
		1 - x^2
		$$
		can be factored, because
		$$
		1 = 1^2
		$$
		implies that
		$$
		1 - x^2
		$$
		truly is “a difference of squares”. And, indeed,
		$$
		1 - x^2 = (1 - x)(1 + x)
		$$
		as per “$\rt{0.04}a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)$”.
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		In relation to distributivity, we should also mention the
		simple but important fact that multiplying a difference by $-1$ <i>reverses</i>
		the difference. That is,
		$$
		(-1)(a - b) \,=\, b - a
		$$
		or, for short,
		$$
		-(a - b) \,=\, b - a
		$$
		because, indeed,
		$$
		\begin{align}
		(-1)(a - b) \,&=\, (-1)(a + (-b)) \\
		\,&=\, (-1)a + (-1)(-b) \\
		\,&=\, -a + b
		\end{align}
		$$
		by distributivity (used in the second step).
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Example 6.</b> We have $-(10 - 3) = 3 - 10$. 
		(Because $-7 = -7$, as it would be, haha.)
	</p>

	<p class="nb" style="display:block">
		<b>Epilogue.</b> Do you remember the near miss between
		$$
		12\cdot 14 \,=\, 168
		$$
		and
		$$
				13 \cdot 13 \,=\, 13^2 \,=\, 169
		$$
		...? Well if you observe, additionally, that
		$$
		\begin{align}
		11\,\cdot\,13 &= 12^2 - 1\\

		10\,\cdot\,12 &= 11^2 - 1\\

		9\,\cdot\,11 &= 10^2 - 1
		\end{align}
		$$
		(etc) you might become suspicious of a pattern! But the
		mystery is rather thin: we have
		$$
		(n - 1)(n + 1) \,=\, n^2 - 1
		$$
		for <i>every</i> real number $n$ because of the formula
		$$
		(a - b)(a + b) \,=\, a^2 - b^2
		$$
		for a difference of squares!
	</p>

	<p class="nb">
		<b>Vocabulary.</b> 
		A pair of algebraic expressions of the form
		$$
		a + b,\, a - b
		$$
		is called a <i>conjugate pair</i>. For example,
		$$
		n + 1,\, n - 1
		$$
		is a conjugate pair, as is
		$$
		\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2},\,\, \sqrt{3} - \sqrt{2}
		$$
		and so on. (Generally speaking, conjugate pairs are good 
		things to multiply together.)
